# Book Summaries
MarkDown files containing summaries of recently read books and Quick guides on several topics. 

Summaries are releative to myself. I've only summarised things that are of interest to me, or are gaps in my own knowledge. 

If you enjoy the summaries, please consider supporting the authors by purchasing the books.

Currently I am now writing my book notes using the app Bear. Once a book is completed, I'll convert it to markdown and upload it complete, rather than having incomplete books.
