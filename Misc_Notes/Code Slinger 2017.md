# Code Slinger 2017

Interesting information:

* 38% of software development community based in London. (More than New York, Paris, San Fran)
* Most popular technology used in London: Python, .Net, Java

## Create an Engineering Culture That Builds Self Scaling Products (By TansferWise)

* Evangelism has been the biggest growth for transfer wise (users telling other uses that they should use Transferwise)
* Has meant they have not had to do to loads of marketing
* Two elements when choosing to use a product:
	* Rational: What can it do for me
	* Emotional: I really like it and cant imagining using something else
* This is done by doing rational so well you feel bad for using another product
* They use NPS Metric (Sales on how likely you are use to a product between 1-10)
	* People in 9-10 range will promote the product
	* Below 6 a detractors - People you need to target
	* Find out how to help people below 6 by questionares
	* The key points that come from the below 6s should be integrated into the brand and fixed.
* Building a great product must be a specific order of magnitude better than your competitors
* Companies that iterate, fail and learn faster will succeed
	* You can do this by giving more power to the teams, rather than management
	* When you have multiple teams, you must remove dependancies between the teams.
	* Each team should be functional without help from other teams
* Culture is extreamly important
* Each team should do a roadmap each quarter. How will this improve their customers experience with the product 
* Key behaviours for product engineering:
	* Product + code ownership - > Everypart is own, any team can edit the code, open source between teams
	* Engineering for customer impact -> Allowing the Devs to interact with the customers, not just support.
	* Inspiration -> If you fail to inspire an engineer as a product manager, you will not inspire a customer
	* Focus & Learnings ->  Not afraid fail. You should not have a culture where if someone messe sup they are fired
	* Honest Postmortems -> You write when something has broke, and you send it to the company/Team
		* What happened
		* What caused it
		* What fixed it
		* What we learnt
	* How many taks can be done in parrallel?
	* Trade offs:
		* Identify what trade offs you are willing to accept


## What Makes a Great Technical Leader (Deloitte Digital)

* Finding your leverage point:
	* You company will pay you more, so they expect more from you
	* The way you scale in a team is by making the team better along with yourself
	* What do you do that makes the team better
* As a junior, the key is learning your craft and contributing where you can
* As a developer, you start taking ownership and understand why things are done in a certain way
* Senior - Mentoring others and managing their time as well
* Techical Lead - Considered an expert in what you do. Thing you are building will have your name on, need to be proud of it. 
* What teams say about what makes a great tech lead:
	* Helping turn individuals into a team
	* Supporting their long-term career goals
	* Understand the members of the team - What od they like? What do they hate? What is their personality like?
	* Create opportunities for them to experience new aspects of the business
	* Protecting the team so they can work sustainably
		* Knowing how to protect your team under various conditions (Eg, tight to deadline, needing to work late)
	* Find your sidekicks - People in the project who will compliment you. People who are good at the things you are not good at. How can you help them as well?
	* Focus on the big picture
	* Anticipating the next challenge - What could happen when we do this and mimise this. Given we now have some extra tech debt, how will we pay this back?
	* Encourage Experiementation - Safe to Fail Environment
	* Solve only the problems others can't solve for themselves - If changing others code, pair with them and show them
	* Make yourself obsolete - Who in the team will you make into my replacement so I can go on and do greater things
* How to get into a tech lead position:
	* Observe - How do they act, what langauge do they use. What is their daily structure like?
	* Listen - Work out what the team is saying. Focus strongly where your team can give you great feedback without worrying
	* Read - Read constantly
		* Great books:
			* Great Boss dead boss
			* Thinking, Fast and Slow
			* Rolling Rocks Downhill
			

## From Honey To Money - Output To Outcome: Empowing Teams to Deliver Value at Speed

* Problems they faced:
	* Higher ups demanding more and more features
	* Lack of focus
	* Value unclear
	* Bugs dominant
	* Output dominant
	* Tactical over strategic
* The HoneyComb principle:
	* Focus
		* What do we want the product to achieve over the next x-y months (Eg, bring old customers back)
		* Does your idea fit the theme?
		* How will we achieve this theme technically and on technically
	* Empowerment:
		* Teams that were autonomous 
		* Teams allowed to prioritize what they want to do
		* increasing ownership
	* Speed
		* Test and learn mindset
		* Agile framkework
		* Continuous delivery + feature toggling
		* Automated testing & Deployment
		* "pizza teams" (if a team is too big to eat 2 large pizzas, its to big)
* The HoneyComb Team setup:
	* Joint Leads = Product + Business
	* X-Fucntional Leads (Dev, UX, QA)
	* All have an equal voice
	* One engineering team alligned to each honeycomb
* Honeycomb Framework:
	* Vision to achieve that is agreed between team\
	* Outcome metrics + targets
	* Tracking + Steering 
	* 3 Month Roadmap
	* 3 Year Sunshire chart
* Self-sufficient temas
	* Each team has own CD pipelines
	* Shared technology principles throughout teams (Eg, patterns to use)
	* Rotating resource & pairing
* Bug Bash
	* Bugs introduced in a release dealt with immediately
	* Bug bash every third month (Week of bug fixing)
	* Focused development on bugs
	* (rewards, eg pint for each bug fixed and merged)
* Feedback 
	* A/B testing
	* Use NPS (Net Promoter Score) to gauge happiness across teams

## Web Components and Polymer at Nuxeo

* Uses Polymer 

## Cyber Security Wants you! (McAfee)

* Must be passionate about secruity
* Having a good perspective "The architect ought, above all thihngs, be skilled in perspective"
* Currently, react time to finding out there has been a cyber security crime is lackluster
* Attacker perspecctives:
	* Cybercriminals/organized crime
	* Recreational/vandals
	* Hackivism/reupation attacks
	* State sponsored cyberspionage cyberattacks 
* Security is making your business resilient, not perfect
* Key measure of cyber security is impact - how much has the crime impacted others.
* Cyber secuirty pipeline -> Connectivity -> information exchange -> Automatic decision Making -> Digital Transformation -> Attacker Threat Landscape
* Secure by design (Add later)
* When thinking about security, think of the WHOLE system, not just devices.
* Where are key points in the system that most people would target?
* Where would most people not think to target?

## Using Dart at Google

* $10B is paid out by google adsense a year
* Adsense UI is constantly rebranded.
* GWT (Writing java code that compiles to javascript)
* Most of Googles UI code is written in GWT
* Material Design = New Design language at google
* Everything in adsense is now written in dart
* Dart is estimated to increase UI development speed by 2 times
* Trade off of dart:
	* + :Faster Developmemnt
	* + :Independant teams
	* + :Quicker inital load
	* + :Higher overall bandwidth
	* + :Complicates interactions between apps
* What does dart give you:
	* Quick page refreshes
	* Concise code 
	* Faster tests
	* Code sharing across Google
	* Refactoing and static analysis
