## 2. Train to Gain
	
* What is your intensity
	* Intention/ force challenge a muscle faces
	* Done in reps done or 1 rep at max
	* Should do 6-12 Reps.
	* Anything less, gains in strength not size
	* Anything more, trains for endurance
* Volume for victory
	* How much work you are doing in a given period of time
	* Reps x Weight x Number of sets
	* Want to do more than 12 sets for a specific muscle per week
	* Depending how often you train a muscle defines how many sets you should do.
	* Spread it out
* Tempo
	* how rapid is the weight moving
	* 3-4 seconds against gravity, 1-2 with gravity 
* Rest
	* Should have day - 2 rest between muscle group training
	* 90 second rest between sets

* HIIT is the best cardio you can do
* Do a 4-1 ration (Rest-High intensity)
	* eg, sprint 15 seconds, rest (15*4), repeat.
* Should increase over time, where you can shorten your ratio to 2-1
