# Hack Your Learning with Tim Ferris

----

## DSSS

### Deconstruction

* Where you take a high level concept and breaking it down into many small chunks
* The idea is to break it into measurable points
* Then you can track your progress
* For example, learning data types could be broken into
	* Types that deal with numbers
	* Types that deal with characters
	* Types that deal with true and false
	* Types that deal with negative numbers
	* Types that deal with A series of numbers/characters/
	* Types that can be sorted
	* Types that are most commmonly used
* You should also ask "Who is good at this who shouldnt be" - These people will be succeeding due to good habits rather than bad habits but being fortunate in other aspects
* Ask who are the best trainers and who are the most contraversal, and understand how they teach others
* The four tools Tim suggests for this are:
	* Reducing - Breaking everything into components called Radicals
	* Interviewing - Asking an expert the most common mistakes people make when learning this skill as well as finding the main principles
	* Reversal - Looking at the final product and back tracking to the initial steps
	* Translating - Learning quick shortcuts (eg, for a language, learn verbs, for programming, learn what objects are)


### Selection

* 80/20 analysis
* Figuring out what key concepts are used most?
* Eg for programming:
	* Data types
	* Algorthims
	* Design patterns
	* unit testing
* Figuring out how many ways you can learn this.
* Which 20% of methods will teach me 80% of the information
* For example. programming:
	* Reading 
	* Lectures
	* Websites
	* Making own program
	* 1 on 1 lessons
		* Which of these will give me the most results? (Making own program)

### Sequencing

* The most undervalued step
* Once you have decided what you are going to learn from Selection - You need to decide how can I put this into logical steps where subjects lead on from each other
* For each skill, what are the:
	* Prerequistes (Technically and physically)
	* What will you know at the end


### Stakes

* Must have incentives for meeting your targets
* Eg, for your job, getting a raise
* But for your own self learning, you need to decide your own incentives for keeping up the act of learning
* These could be rewards or punishments
* Tim advices a betting pool
	* Eg, if you miss a work out, you have to pay someone Â£5 each time you miss a work out
