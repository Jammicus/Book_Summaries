## Chapter 1: Basic Principles

* Your desk should be like a cockpit
	* Should be lean and function with ease
	* You want to have things at a fingertip to do what you do most often
	* Clear space is good. A desk is for working, not storing stuff
	* Be a minimalist when it comes to what you have on your desk permanently.
* Everything at your desk should fall into a few catorgies
	* Permanent Stuff:
		* Equipment (Computer, phone, keyboard...)
		* Supplies (Pens, papers..)
		* Decoration(Photos, awards..)
		* Reference (Things that do not go on your desktop, but in filing cabinets and on bookshelves.)
	* Temporary Stuff:
		* Input to be processed (Things that need to be done. These must go in an inbox or a specifed place on your desk.)
		* Action reminders (Task management software, or your planner)
		* Support materials( Books, ect. These should only be on your desk when working with them)
* If something does not fall into the above categories, its junk and should be removed.
* Any equipment that you use everyday you can keep on the desktop. 
* Things you use occasionally should go in draws.
* Supplies should go in draws, extra supplies should go into a supply area
* Remember that your desk is for working, not storing work or reminding you of work.
	* Your desk is for working on your current task
* Dont manage your life from stacks of things to do
	*  manage your life from your calendar and todo list
* Everything that comes your way is either trash, information or action items.
	* If information: Read it then toss it, or , keep it then read it then file it. Never keep it on your desk.
	* If its an action item, do it immediately if possible, otherwise add it to your todo list and either put it with support material if you will need it again or throw it away.
	* If trash...throw it away
* Create work centres - this is structure and flow of your desk
	* These can be desktop, desk drawers, and file drawers
* Use P-L-A-C-E to oranize things intelligently
	* Purge - Get red of the unnecessary
	* Like - Group similar things together
	* Access - Once you have grouped things, place them accordinging to how often you will need them.
	* Contain - Use drawer dividers and other containers when relevent
	* Evaludate - Step back and make modifications to your desk if need be.
* Have interchangeable systems at work and home
	* Your home system should mirror your work system. 
* Have a mobile component
	* Backpack/briefcase with your laptop.
