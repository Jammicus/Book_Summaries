# The Happiness Advantage - The Seven Principles that Fuel Success and Performance at work

## The Seven Principles

* The happiness Advantage
	* This principle teaches us how to retrain out brains to capitalise on positivity and improve our productivity and performance
* The Fulcrum and the Lever
	* How we experience the world, and our ability to succeed within it, constantly changes based on our mindset. 
	* This principle teaches us how we can adjust our mindset (our fulcrum) in a way that gives us the power (the lever) to be more fulfilled and successful
* The Tetris Effect 
	* When our brains get stuck in a pattern that focuses on stress, negativity and failure, we set ourselves up to fail. 
	* This principle teaches us how to retrain our brains to spot patterns of possibility, so we can see-and seize-opportunity whenever we look.
* Falling up
	* IN the midst of defeat, stress and crisis, our brains map different paths to help us cope.
	* This principle is about finding the mental path that not only leads us up out of failure or suffering, but teaches us to be happier and more successful because of it.
* The Zorro Circle
	* When challenges loom and we get overwhelmed, our rational brains can get hijacked by emotions
	* This principle teaches us how to regain control by focusing first on small, manageable goals, and them gradually expanding our circle to achieve bigger and bigger ones. 
* The 20-second rule
	* Sustaining lasting changes often feels impossible because our willpower is limited. And when willpower fails, we fall back on our old habits and succumb to the path of least resistance
	* This principle shows how, by making small energy adjustments, we can reroute the path of least resistance and replace bad habits with good ones
* Social Investment
	* IN the midst of challenges and stress, some people choose to hunker down and retreat within themselves.
	* But the most successful people invest in their friends, peers, and family members to propel themselves forward
	* This principle teaches us how to invest more in one of the greatest predictors of success and excellence - our social support network

## The Happiness Advantage

* Untold generations have been led to believe that happiness is orbited around success.
* However, we are now learning that the opposite is ture.
* When we are happy - we are smarter, more motivated and thus more successful. 
* Happiness is the center, and success revolves around it.
* The most successful people, the ones with the competitive edge, don’t look to happiness as some distant reward for their achievements, nor grind through their days on neutral or negative; they are the ones who capitalise on the positive and reap the rewards at every turn.

### Defining Happiness

* There is no single meaning; happiness is relative to the person experiencing it. 
* This is why scientists often refer to it as “subjective well-being” - because its based on how we feel about our own lives.
* In essence the best judge of how happy you are is you. 

> Happiness =  the experience of positive emotions- pleasure combined with deeper feelings of meaning and purpose.   

* Happiness can be broken down into 3 measurable components:
	* Pleasure
	* Engagement
	* Meaning
* Thinking about previous happy events triggers dopamine releases, which results in increased performance. 
* Those who capitalise positive every change they get ahead of those who wait for happiness to come.
* Happiness is not static, its dynamic
* You need  to give yourself bolts of  happiness to do well.
* You should give your employees bolts of happiness to
* You can do that by reminding them:
	* Encouraging words
	* telling them that they are doing well
	* How you appreciate their work.
* Techniques you can use to boost your own happiness:
	* Visualizing yourself being successful
	* Recalling past instances where you have been successful 
	* Taking a moment out to do something that you enjoy which will bring you happiness.
	* Meditate
	* Find something to look forward to
	* Commit conscious acts of kindness (Being kind to someone actually increases your own happiness)
	* Infuse positivity into your surroundings
	* Exercise
	* Spend money on experiences, rather than stuff.
	* Exercise a signature strength (Something you are good at)


## The Fulcrum And The Lever

> Archimedes said that : Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world  

* Our power to maximise our potential is based on two important things:
	* Length of our level - how much potential power and possibility we believe we have
	* The position of our fulcrum - the mindset with which we generate the power to change. 
* Your potential is not fixed. The move we move our fulcrum (or mindset) the more our lever lengthens and so the more power we generate. 
* The “mental consistiution” - the way we conceive of ourselves - has a direct influence upon your potential 
* What feels like a blink of an eye to some, can feel like an eternity to others. We all have our own perceived notion of time that we generate internally
* Mindset does not change how we feel about an experience, it actually changes the objective results oft hat experience. 
* Workplace beliefs can actually change the concrete results of our efforts and our work. 

> The mental construction our daily activities, more than the activity itself, defines our reality  

* The most successful people adopt a mindset that not only makes their workdays more bearable, but also helps them work longer, harder and faster than their negative mindset peers.
	* For them, 24/7 is only an objective clock-calendar measurement : they take the same units of time given to everyone and use their mindset to become more efficient and productive.
* Your view of the activity causes the desired results
	* Find positives in everything you do, even if it is a struggle 
* Your mindset on your own ability greatly affects your potential 
* “ What identity are you wearing today”
	* If you’re wearing soft doubt, and negative emotions, you’ll be that way. 
	* Instead, believe what you are great at.
* When you need a little boost, always remind yourself of relevant skills you have, rather than what you lack.
* You must believe in your own abilities and believing that you can improve on your abilities. 
	* Aka  “Growth mindset”
* Believing in your own abilities actually boosts your performance in those abilities.
* Employees have three main mindsets that affect jobs performance, known as work orientations. These are viewing your work as:
	* A job
	* A career
	* A calling
* Those who view their work as a job, do very poorly, and are more interested in looking at time away from work.
* Those who view their work as a career, not only work out of necessity, but also to advance and succeed
* People who view their work as their calling view work as an end in itself; their work is fulfilling not because of external rewards but because they feel it contributes to the greater good, draws on their personal strengths, and gives them meaning and purpose. 
* Employees typically become the kind of writer that their manager expects them to be, known as the Pygamalion Effect. 
* People act as we expect them to act, which means that a leaders expectations about what he thinks will motivate his employees often end up coming true.
* You need to me optimistic and believe your employees can do it. 
* Every monday, as yourself:
	* Do I believe that the intelligence and skills of my employees are not fixed, but an be improved with effort?
	* Do i believe that my employees want to make the effort, just as they want to find meaning and fulfilment in their jobs?
	* How am I conveying these beliefs in my daily words and actions
* While its important to not have unrealistic expectations about your potential. 


## The Tetris Effect

* The Tetris effect = Someone who is unable to break a pattern of thinking or behaving 
* You need to train yourself to scan for the positives rather than the negatives. 
* When you are looking for something, you will see it everywhere. 
* Instead of creating a cognitive pattern that looks for negatives and blocks success, look for opportunities and ideas that allow our success rate to grow. 
* The difference between people who capitalise on chances and those who watch them pass by, or miss them entirely, is all a matter of focus. 
* When you are stuck in a negative state, you are incapable to seeing it. 
* A good way to get into a good testers effect is to make a list of the good things in your job, career or life. 
	* Do this everyday until you notice them yourself. 

## Falling Up 

* The human brain is constantly creating and revising mental maps to help us navigate our way through this complex and ever-changing world
* On every mental map after crisis or adversity, there are 3 mental maps:
	* Where you circle around where you currently care 
	* Further negative consequences
	* from failure or setback to a place where we are even stronger and more capable than before. 
* By scanning mental maps for positive opportunities, and by rejecting the belief that every down in life leads us only further downward, we give ourselves the greatest power possible: the ability to move up not despite the setbacks but because of them. 
* Celebrating failures, knowing that it may  bad, but it will always lead to something better, is very powerful
* Its recommended we fail early and often. 

> We can only learnt o deal with failure by actually experiencing failure, by living through it. The earlier we face difficulties and drawbacks,the better prepared we are to deal with the inevitable obstacles along our path.  

* Encourage others to try and fail early 
* No matter what situation you are in, you can find power in it. Your job is to identify it and use it to empower yourself
* Have a positive “explanatory style” , This is how we explain the nature of past events, has a crucial impact on your happiness and future success.
	* People with an optimistic explanatory style interpret adversity as being local and temporary., while those with a pessimistic explanatory style see these events as more global and permanent. 
	* Virtually all avenues of success, we now know, are dictated by explanatory style. 
* Use the ABDC model for turning adversity to opportunity:
	* Adversirty (Event we can’t change)
	* belief (Our reaction to the event, why we thought it happened and what we think it means for the future. is the problem only temporary and local in nature or do we think it is permanent and pervasive)
	* Consequence (Belief we have for this event)
	* Dispuation (Challenging the belief you now have)
	* When thinking about this, do it in someone else voices in your head. 

## The Zorro Circle

> Limiting your focus to small manageable goals can expand your sphere of power  

* One of the biggest drivers of success is the belief that our behaviour matters that we have control over our future. 
* If you concentrate your efforts on small, manageable goals, we regain the feeling of control so crucial to performance. 
* Feeling that we are in control, that we are masters of our own fate at work and at home, is one of the strongest drivers for both well-being and performance. 
* Its more to do with how much control we think we have, rather than how much we actually have. 
* Identify what aspects that are stressing you which you actually have control over
	* Work on the aspects that you have control over. 
* A cluttered desk is fundamentally no different from a cluttered in box. The thing of our lives have gained control over the functional of our lives, and productivity suffers as a result. 
* Keep things clear, such as your inbox, desk, anything that you need productively 


## The 20-Second Rule

> How to Turn Bad Habits into Good Ones By Minimising Barriers to Change  

* Without action, knowledge is often meaningless. 
* To be excellent we cannot simply think or feel excellent, we must act excellently. 
* Positive habits are hard to keep, no matter how commonsensical they might be. 
* Humans are biologically prone to habit, and it is because we are  “mere bundles of habits” that we are able to automatically perform many of our daily tasks - from brushing our teeth first thing in the morning to setting the alarm before climbing into bed at night. 
* Habits form because our brain actually changes in response to frequent practice. 
* willpower is useless. 
* Self-Control is the key. 
* The path of least resistance is especially maladaptive, luring us into a  while host of bad habits that breed procrastination and undercut productivity. 
* The 20 second rule: The lower the activation energy for habits you want to adopt, and rise it for habits you want to avoid
	* Eg keep fruit next to you at all times
	* And keep chocolate hidden away in a far to reach place. 
* The authors suggests that if you want to go to the gym in the morning, sleep in your gym clothes and just put your shoes on and go as soon as you get up. 
* The key to permeant, positive change is to create habits that automatically pay dividends without continued concert effect or extensive reserves of willpower. The key to creating these habits is ritual, repeated practice, until the actions become ingrained in your brains neural chemistry. and the key to daily practice is to put your desired actions as close to the path of least resistance as possible. 


## Social Investment

> Why Social Support is Your Single Greatest Asset   

* When we encounter an unexpected challenge or threat, the only way to save ourselves is to hold on tight to the people around us and not let go.
* The most successful people turn outwards during difficulties, and hold tight to their social support. 
* Capitalise on even the smallest moments we spend interacting with others. 


## The Ripple Effect

* Once we start capitalising on the happiness advantage in our own lives, the positive changes quickly ripple out. 
* Your thoughts and actions are constantly shaping and reshaping the neural pathways in the brain. 
* As your brain becomes more adept at one habit, it improves your ability to capitalise on another.
* Every big wave starts small
