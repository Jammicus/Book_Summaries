## Chapter 1 - Accelerated Learning & Memorisation Techniques - The Ultimate Keys to Success


* The notion that the most successful learners are not only highly intelligent, but also highly motivated, is simply wrong.
* No one feels motivated to study all the time. 
* Learning new skills takes times, effort, and entails overcoming setbacks.
* High achievers know that it is pointless to sit around and wait until they feel motivated to do something.

## Chapter 2: Setting Yourself Up for Success: How your Attitude & Life style affect your learning

* There are three components you need to put in place when becoming a star learner:
	* Tried and tested techniques you will find later in this book.
	* Constructive mental attitude
	* Healthy lifestyle 
* Having a growth mindset - A mindset were you believe with time and effort you will improve, is a foundation for anyone looking to learn a new skill. 
* Believing that hard work is vital to success will develop a more positive attitude towards difficult tasks than those who believe success is down to intelligence. 
* Your efforts will take you further than your innate ability, you will start to get the results you seek
* No genius or high achiever got to the top without some serious effort along the way.
* You’ll find that your work ethic and willingness to take on increasingly difficult challenges will be critical to your success.
* Motivation does not show up on command, it must be cultivated. 
	* Waiting to be motivated is a waste of time. You need to do it even when you are not motivated.
* When the urge to work towards a long-term outcome is stronger than the urge to do something more fun in the short-term, we become motivated to work on a task
* If you lack the drive to learn some new material, start by reminding yourself on the rewards you will reap asa result of your efforts.
* The number of distractions in your environment will also determine how readily you will be able to commit your attention to one task. 
	* For example, leave your phone in a separate room when you study
* You need to take responsibility for your own learning, this will make you feel empowered.
* In regards to diet, you should cut back on refined sugars and processed grains when you need to give your brain a boost.
* A good sleep routine is also essential. 
* Exercise is also a powerful tool to have in your learning arsenal. Regular moderate exercise helps safeguard the structure and function of brain cells. 

## Chapter 3 : How to Absorb information Rapidly: Learning to read more quickly than you ever thought possible.

* If you tend to move your lips whilst reading apiece of text, you will cause your reading speed to slow down. 
* Your eyes are faster than your mouth. 
* Regression - Where your eyes go back in a piece of text, is also counter productive. 
* When you finished reading a section, pause and ask yourself if you have understood the key message contained within the text
	* If you cannot summarise the text, read it again. 
	* The aim here is to increase your reading speed while still being able to understand the content. 
* If reading a text book, look at the questions at the end of a  chapter before reading the chapter - try and answer then as you read along. 
* The best long-term method of improving your reading skills is to broaden your vocabulary and general knowledge.
* Read widely, from different mediums and genres. 
* The human brain can only work for 50-90 minutes at a time. Take a 15 minute break after that time. 
* Get in the habit of looking at the first and last programs of a chapter. These contain key information. 
* Reading multiple books at the same time allows you to synchronise ideas across different things. 
* Make a schedule to read each day, even if its only 15 minutes per book. 
* Note taking is an essential step in moving from reading to memorisation and deep-level learning.

## Chapter 4: How To Learn By listening

* Before attending a talk or discussion, do a little bit of research
* Skim the headings before diving into a textbook chapter. Its a good idea to gain an overview o the key concepts in advance of a lecture. 
* Active listening begins with an open mind. 
* If you want to use your critical thinking skills, its essential to listen without giving into knee-jerk reactions. 
* When the speaker pauses, mentally summarise their last point.
* Ask yourself whether you could bring someone who had arrived late up to speed. If you can’t, you need to listen more carefully
* Ask yourself if you agree with their view: Why if so or not so?
* If a topic of a presentation is dull, make connections between the material and your personal life.
* When reading or listening, find 3 reasons why the knowledge you are acquiring will benefit you.
* Asking yourself questions whilst listening to a talk will also help you concentrate on what is being said.
* There are 6 questions you can ask yourself while you listen:
	* What
	* Where
	* How
	* When 
	* Who
	* Why
* Write them at the top of your notepad, and use each at least once during the session. 
* Speakers who feel appreciated is more likely to put in the necessary effort to make their lecture more engaging. This makes their audience more interested. 

## Chapter 5: Organising Information: How to take notes that get results.

* The worst note taking habit is the tendency to take notes for no other purpose than to get everything down on paper.
* Effective not taking allows you to link the import ideas, the high-level concepts contained within a topic together and filter out the stuff you do not need to know.
* There are 5 main approaches to note taking.
	* Writing a brief description of each key subject on a piece of paper, and then adding additional details beneath them. 
	* The Cornell method: Dividing the page into 3 sections called “notes” “cue/questions” and “summary”
	* “Flow system”: Instead of trying to capture every detail of a lecture or book chapter, students should learn to emphasise the most relevant information, create their own depiction or transcription of the information presented, make connections between ideas. This should give you a unique document that captures the gist of the content in a way the student will understand. 
		* Link bits together with arrows and pictures. This will create a “flow system”.
		* Making sure every time you make a note, its in your own words.
		* Backlinking: When you find something new that links to something you read in the past, link them together.
	* Mind maps. linking everything together. 
	* Lazy mans method: Print a copy of notes and take them to a lecture then annotate them while there.

## Chapter 6: The Fastest Way to Test Your Knowledge: The Feynman Technique.

* This can help you develop an in-depth understanding quickly.
* You cannot claim to fully comprehend an idea until you can simplify it.
* If you cannot provide a clear overview of a phenomenon, then you don’t really understand it. 
* It is easier to commit something to memory if you have to teach it to others.
* To do this, write your notes, then assess whether you can simplify it, or teach this to another and that you’ll be able to answer questions.
* Make use of analogies, these illustrate concepts in a way that make them come alive. 


## Chapter 7: Learning By Experience & Reflection: Experimental Learning 
* Linking information with emotions creates memory links very quickly. 
* Experience is really the best teacher. 
* This can be broken down into:
	* Experiencing -> Solving problems
	* Reflecting -> Summarise 
	* Generalising -> Linking with other things or similar concepts. 
	* Applying -> Applying in your life. (This is where things get embedded.)

## Chapter 8: The Killer Strategy That Separates The Best Students From The Rest of The Class.

* The key here is experiential learning.
* The more you practice, the better you get.
* Common mistake is reading loads of theory, but not applying. 
* Writing your own test papers are  a great idea. 
* Practice recalling and communicating information under a specific set of circumstances.
* Make sure you balance hard work with breaks. 

## How To Use Flashcards Effectively. 

* Preparation of flash cards is an active learning strategy.
* Flash cards are best used when trying to learn highly specific facts. Not when trying to link concepts together. 
* Use words and illustrations on your flash cards. 
* Try to use both sides as a question, can you link back to the other side?

## Chapter 10: Spaced Repetition: How to Realise The Full Potential Of Flashcards

* Ideal of spaced repetition is short sessions over time. 
* Place your flashcards into groups of:
	* Daily. Once you have got it right move it to:
	* Every other day. Once you have got that right move it to 
	* Every two days. Once you get it right, your done.
* Tackle the hardest tasks first.
* You should do space repetition with tests papers as well.

## Chapter 11: Music, Binaural Beats and Learning. 

* Beats are an auditory illusion created by the brain. 
* Binaural beats a 2 beats and are separated and fed into each ear.
* Apparently, this can help you memorise. Though I think this is bullshit.
* Listening to music while studying in a highly debated topic.
* Music has a detrimental effect of performance. 

## Chapter 12: How To Beat Procrastination & Get Down To Work Fast

* Don’t wait for motivation.
* Just do it.
* Use the 5 minute rule: If you feel the same way after 5 minutes, you can stop.  Often you won’t feel the same way. 
* Use the Pomodoro Technique. 25 minutes then break, do this 4 times then have a long break. 
	* Stay completely silent during the 25 minutes.
* Schedule time to do enjoyable activities each day. Studying all the time will drain you and actually make you less productive. 
* Schedule your day completely, and stick to it. 
* If you have bad study habits linked to one place, start working in another place. This is disassociate the habits you have created.
* If you find to hard to sit down and study for more than half an hour, do the following:
	* Make sure you’ve had plenty of exercise outside of the study session
	* Make a point for getting up for a few minutes each hour and do some stretches.
	* Invest in a standing desk.

## Chapter 13: The Truth About Learning Styles.

* Mainly a load of shit. Not much evidence supports it. 
* However, The format and the material being taught is more important in determining the learning outcomes. 
* Your personal expectations  - Your belief in your ability to learn, is more important than how to learn it.

## Chapter 14: How To Master Mind Mapping

* 5 basic steps:
	* Decide the keyword, or brief title, that encapsulates the subject.
	* Add 4/5 branches in different colours
	* .Add one word for each branch, which should link to the centre of your page.  This words should be detailed (Eg, for computers, 4 branches should be Laptops, desktops, servers, tablets)
	* Use colour to add information to these branches
	* Make small sketches or draw symbols that associate with each topic.

## Chapter 15: Powerful Mnemonic Systems That Work

* IF you can arrange the words into an acronym that is somehow relevant to the topic, you should.
* You may need to reword a piece of information to make it into an acronym, thats OK as long as the meaning stays the same
* Making a song out of it can be useful.
* Stories can also be useful.
* Humor can also be useful.
* When doing tests_practicing. Practice that you can recall the mnemonic and what each part of it stands for_ what the purpose of it is.
* The ideal use of the mnemonic is for pieces of information that are hard to remember on their own. 

## Chapter 16: The Method Of Loci.

* Idea is to remember a route, and on that route, key things are.
* You mentally walk at route, and recount whats on the way.
* You need to able to walk the route repeatedly and remember everything on it. 
* Images on these route should not be too surreal. This is actually harder to remember. 
* They should be striking, but simple.

## Chapter 17: Environmental Context  & Cues-  Are they important factors in learning.

* You should undertake studying in a way that mimics the exam or context.
* If you practice in the same environment, the better you do.
* Don’t listen to music, you will get accustomed to it, and then try and find the music when you hit the exam.
* Conjuring up a mental image of the place in which you learned an idea can help you remember it. 
* This is useful if you’re answering short-answer or essay questions, but useless for multiple-choice questions.
* Smells can also bring back memories. Study with a specific aftershave, then wear it to the exam.

## Chapter 18: Interleaved Practice - How To Polish Your Skills Quickly.

* Learning things in a sequential order is not a good idea. 
* Interleaved practice, where you don’t learn in a specific order, by practicing things in randomised order is very useful.
* As an example, have homework with different lectures in, rather than homework from one lecture. This reinforces learning from previous lectures (Eg, interleaved practice!)
* When you switch material around so that no two consecutive problems can be solved using the same strategy, you are forcing the brain to do a bit more work. Your brain has to search, which essentially acts as repetitions that consolidate learning
* Two Key aspects of interleaved practice
	* Problems that are interleaved with others of a different kind
	* Problems of the same type are presented at intervals, rather than blocks.
* What this means for you:
	* Don’t work through batches of the same type of problems
	* Instead, create batches with different types of problems, and work through them. 
* Side note: This is ver good for motor skills. 
* Very good for helping you understand abstract concepts adds pot patterns you may fail to identify at a conscious level. 
* Don’t do this technique by itself, you should mix it with flashcards _papers_  so on.

## Chapter 19: Accelerated Learning As Part of A Group. 

* In the first meeting, decide what to do study over the coming weeks/months
* Make it clear that everyone will be expected to participate.
* 3 hour session max.
* Discussions should be finished with a summary of the discussion.

## Chapter 20: How To Cram Before An Exam. 

* Try and avoid this. its not a good idea.
* Which topics get the most space in your text-book, receive the most attention from your professor, and come up on the practice test.
* Write down the main ideas, instead of full answers.
* As soon as a test begins, scribble down the key concepts on the bottom of the page, or the back of the test.

## Chapter 21: How To Learn A Language Fast

* Experiential learning is the key
* Talking with native speakers, getting feedback on mistakes 
* However immersion does not always guarantee that someone will pick up the language
* The primary factor is the degree to which the new language is similar in structure to a learners native language
* You need to identify the most common words and devote our time to memorising them. This will lead you to be able to converse on a number of everyday topics.
* Comment on everyday things in that language

## Chapter 22: Social Learning - How To Remember Names & Faces

* Ask yourself what a good relationship with the person will mean to you. This will become an incentive to learn their name,.
* Link their name with someone or something you already know.
