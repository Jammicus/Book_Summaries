# High Performance Habits: How Extraordinary People Become That Way

-----

* **Excellence is an art won by training and habituation**

## High Performance Lessons

This book aims to answer the following:

* Why do some individuals and teams succeed more quickly than others and sustain that success over the long term?
* Of those who pull it off, why are some miserable and others happy on their journey?
* What motivates people to reach for higher levels of success in the first place, and what kinds of habits, training, and support help them improve faster?

**With the right habits, anyone can dramatically increase results and become a high performer in almost any field of endeavour**

* High performance is not achieved by a specific kind of person but rather by a specific set of practices (Which we shall call high performance habits)
* Not all habits are equal, some are bad, some are good, and some are better and best.
* It should be noted that what's achievable is not always whats important.
* Certainty, is the enemy of growth and high performance. Its a fools dream. It ultimately blinds you, and sets false of fixed limits, and creates automatic habits that become predictable bad thinking and openings for your competitors to surpass you.

## What is High Performance?

* `High performance refers to succeeding beyond standard norms, consistently over the long term`
* A high performer in any field isn't just good at a singular task or skill - she or he has learned adjacent competencies to complement a particular expertise. (They are not one hit wonders)
* They have multiple skill sets that allow them to succeed over the long term and - importantly - lead others.
* High performance people do not end up successful. They're steady. They regularly beat expectations. There is a consistency to their efforts that eludes their peers.
* **High performers sustained success is due in large part to their healthy approach to living. Its not just about achievement in a profession or in just on area of interest. Its about creating a high performance life, in which you experience an ongoing feeling of full engagement, joy, and confidence that comes from being your best self.**

## What We Know About High Performers

* High performers are more successful than their peers, yet they are less stressed
	* This is not to say that they don't feel stress, but they cope better, stay more resilient, and experience less severe performance dips related to fatigue, distraction and overwhelm.
* High performers love challenges and are more confident that they will achieve their goals despite adversity
	* They look forward to trying new things and they believe in their abilities to figure things out.
* High performers are healthier than their peers
	* They eat better
	* They work out more.
	* The top 5 percent of high performers are 40% more likely to exercise 3 times peer week.
* High Performers are Happy
* High Performers are admired
	* This is because to become a high performer, ego takes a backseat to service.
	* High performers have mastered the art of influencing others in such a way that others feel respected, valued, and appreciated - and more likely to become high performers themselves
* High performers get better grades and reach higher positions of success
	* High performance is statistically correlated with GPA.
	* High performers are more likely to be CEO's and senior executives.
	* This is because their habits help them lead others and climb organisational charts
* High Performers work passionately regardless of traditional rewards
	* **High performance does not correlate with compensation**
	* High performers work hard not because of money, but because of something called *necessity*
	* They're rarely feel their work is "thankless" or that others don't appreciate how hard they work -  this is due to the way they approach their work, in a more purposeful manner which helps them feel more engaged, competent and satisfied
* High Performers are assertive (For the right reasons)
	* They jump into experiences and express themselves, not to "conquer" or even to compete.
	* They are assertive because of a habit of courage in sharing new ideas, engaging in complex conversations, expressing their real thoughts and dreams, and standing up for themselves.
* High Performers see and serve beyond their strengths
	* **They're less into "finding their strengths", and more into "adaptive service" -  exploring what needs fixing and growing into the person who can fix it**
	* The question they ask is less often "Who am I and what am I good at?"  and more "What is required to be of service here, and how can I grow into that or lead others to deliver that?"
	* High performers don't report working on their strengths any more than other people do, so that focus ins't what gives them the edge
* High Performers are uniquely productive - they've mastered prolific quality output
	* They produce more quality output that matters in their field.
	* Its not that they get more done per se - its that they get more things done that are **highly valued** in their primary field of interest
* High performers are adaptive servant leaders
	* They tend to be leaders who can adapt to challenging circumstances and guide others to their own successes and contributions.
	* High performers can go from project to project and succeed, over and over
	* **They don't just develop skill, they develop people**

## The habits of high performance

* Six main habits we will called HP6
* They have to do with clarity, energy, necessity, productivity, influence and courage.
* They reflect what high performers actually do continually - from goal to goal, from project to project, from team to team, from person to person.
* Each of these habits is learnable, improvable, and deployable across all contexts of life.
* Traditionally, habits are created when we do something so many times that it becomes almost automatic.
	* This book is not about that sort of habits.
* This book defines habits as a conscious act, different to the traditional notation.
* **DELIBERATE HABITS USUALLY WON'T COME EASILY**
	* You have to practice them with real mental focus, especially in changing environments.
	* You'll have to use them as a checklist, just as a pilot uses preflight checklist before every take off.
* High performers never stop consciously conditioning and strengthening their habits.
* Real success -holistic, long-term success- doesn't come from doing what's natural, certain, convenient or automatic. Its when you move outside of your comforts

## Permission Granted

* Beyond habits, the most common thing holding people back is **that they don't feel they deserve it**
* When making decisions, **Always remember that the main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing - where the main thing**

## Finding What Matters

* High performers do things differently from the way others do, and their practices can be replicated across projects regardless of your personality, past or preference.
* **If you want to reach higher levels of performance, you must consistently do the following:**


* Seek clarity on who you want to be, how you want to interact with others, what you want, and what will bring you the greatest meaning
	* What kind of person do I want to be while i'm doing this?
	* How should I treat others?
	* What are my intentions and objectives?
	* What can I focus on that will bring me a sense of connection and fulfilment?
* Generate Energy so that you can maintain focus, effort and wellbeing
* Raise the necessity for exceptional performance
	* Actively tapping into the reasons you absolutely must perform well.
	* This could be a mix of internal standards and external demands
* Increase productivity in your primary field of interest
	* Focus on prolific quality output (PQO) in the area in which you want to be known and to drive impact.
	* Minimise distractions that steal your attention from creating PQO
* Develop influence with those around you.
* Demonstrate courage by expressing your ideas, taking bold action, and standing up for yourself and others, even in the face of fear, uncertainty, treat, or changing conditions.
	* Courage is not an occasional act, but a trait of choice and will


## High Performance Habits

Personal:

* Seek Clarity
* Generate energy
* Raise necessity

Social:

* Increase productivity
* Develop influence
* Demonstrate courage

## Strengths Alone are Never Enough

* Without clarity, energy, necessity, productivity, influence and courage, a strength is worthless.
* No one "innately" lacks any of the high performance habits.
* High performers are not lucky stiffs loaded with a great big bag of  strengths at birth.
* Many people make excuses for their poor performance.  This is a load of shit.
* **If you want to focus on something, focus on the HP6 to improve a teams and your performance**

## A Rising Tide Lifts All Boats - One Habit Lifts All Others

* An improvement in one of the HB6 habits will improve the others.
* The HB6 predict the overall happiness, meaning that higher your score in any habit, the greater the odds you'll report being happy in life.

## Is There A High Performance "State of Mind"?

* When people talk about how the feel in high performance, they report feeling full of engagement, joy and confidence (In that order)
	* This means that they tend to be fully immersed in what they are doing, they enjoy that they're doing, and they have confidence int heir ability to figure things out.

## Personal high Performance Habits

### Seeking Clarity

* You need to be able to answer:
	* Who am I? (Strengths and weaknesses)
	* What are my goals? (Unambiguous and challenging goals)
	* Whats my plan? (How am I going to get what I want.)
* Focusing on the future and being able to divine how you will achieve excellence is needed.
* Rarely do high achievers focus on the present
* **Its more about who they wanted to be and how to become that**

#### Practice One - Envision The Future Four

##### Self

1. Describe how you've perceived yourself in the following situations over the past several months -  With your significant other, at work, with the kids fo team, in social situations with strangers
2. Now ask "Is that who I really see myself being in the future?" How would my future self look, feel, and behave differently in those situations
3. If you could describe yourself in 3 aspirational words - Words that would sum up who you are at your best in the future - What would those words be? Why are those words meaningful to you? **Once you have found those words, but them as an alarm in your phone that goes off several times a day.**

##### Social

* High performers also have clear intentions about how they want to treat other people
* They have high situational awareness and social intelligence, which helps them succeed and lead.
* They know who they want to be and how they want to interact with others.
* They ask questions like:
	* How can I be a good person or leader in this upcoming situation
	* What will the other person(s) need?
	* What kind of mood and tone do I want to set?
* High performers often want to appear as:
	* Thoughtful
	* Appreciative
	* Respectful
	* Open
	* Honest
	* Empathetic
	* Loving
	* Caring
	* Kind
	* Present
	* Fair
* High performers want to be respected and appreciated
* The issue of respect specifically comes up in a lot  of conversations with high performers
	* They want to be respected and they want to demonstrate respect with others.
	* This matters to them in all areas of their life, including home.

**What is apparent across all high performers is that they anticipate positive social interactions and they strive consciously and consistently to create them**

##### Skills

* High performers are very clear about the skill sets they need to develop now to win in the future.
* They don't draw a blank when you ask them "What three skills are you currently working to develop so you'll be more successful next year?"
* **High performers have blocks in the calendar cleared out for learning every day**
* You should build a curriculum for yourself and actively engage in the learning.
* Each blocked out time of learning should be for one thing.
* **High performers are also working on skills that focus on what I call their primary field of interest (PFI)**
	* These are specifics in their interest, For a developer, it could be learning multithreading, or how to create a binary tree.
	* They focus more on skill building than on casual exploration.
	* **High performers approach their learning not as generalists, but as specialists.**

**Look to the future, Identify key skills, obsessively develop those skills**

How to do this:

1. Think about your PFI (Primary field of interest) and write down three skills that make people successful in that field
2. Under each skill, write down what you will do to develop it, will you read, practice, get a coach, go to a training? When? Set up a plan to develop those skills, put in your calendar, and stay consistent
3. Now think about your PFI and write down three skills that you will need in order to succeed in that field five to ten years from now. What new skill sets will you likely need then? Keep those skills on your radar, and start developing them sooner rather than later

##### Service

* How high performers consider their service to the world.
* High performers care deeply about the difference they are going to make for others and in the future in general, so they cater today's activities to delivering those contributions with heart and elegance.
* They often speak of how all the extra efforts they make to wow people today are vitally important to leaving a lasting legacy tomorrow
* **They Obsess over the small details**

**When someone becomes disconnected from the future, and their contribution to it, they underperform**

* What will provide the most value to those you serve? This is the key question high performers obsess about
* They give an extraordinary amount of thought to questions of service:
	* How to add value
	* Inspire those around them
	* and make a different.
* They eliminate things that do not  matter anymore - They do not live in the past.

Exercise 3: Define whats meaningful

* Not every mountain is worth the climb
* High performers have a critical eye in figuring out what is going to be meaningful to their life experience.
* When most people talk about having meaning at work, they typically discuss:
	* Enjoyment of the tasks of work
	* Alignment of personal values with the work
	* Fulfilment from the outcomes of the work.
* High performers prefer challenge, rather than comfort.

**Passion + Growth + Contribution = Personal Satisfaction**

**You need to bring more conscious and consistent thought to what you will find meaningful in life**

Ask yourself:

2. The activities or projects that I should stop doing, because they are not bringing me any sense of meaning, are...
3. If I was going to add new activities that bring me more meaning, the first ones I would add are....

### Generate Energy


#### Releasing Tension

1. Close your eyes for the next minute or two
2. Repeat the word "Release" In your mind over and over. As you do, command your body to release all the tension in your shoulders, in your neck, in your face and jaw. Release the tension in your body
3. When you feel you've released some tensions - think about what you want to feel and archive in the next activity you're about to take on. When you open your eyes, ask "What energy do I want to bring into this next activity? How can I do this next activity with excellence? How can I enjoy the process?"

#### Bring the joy
* High performs tend to follow similar habits every day. They tend to:

1. Cultivate the emotions they want to experience, in advance of key events. They think about how they want to feel and ask themselves questions, or practice visualisations that generate those feelings
2. Anticipate positive outcomes from their actions. They're optimistic and clearly believe that their actions will be rewarded
3. Imagine possible stressful situations and how their best self might gracefully handle them. As much as they anticipate positive outcomes, they're realistic about hitting snags, and they prepare themselves for difficulties
4. Seek to insert appreciation, surprise, wonder and challenge into their day
5. Steer social interactions toward positive emotions and experiences.
6. Reflect regularly on all that.

Exercise : Ask yourself each day:

* What can I be excited about today?
* What or who might trip me up or cause stress, and how can i respond in a positive way, from my highest self?
* Who can i surprise today with a thank you, a gift, or a moment of   appreciation.

**Gratitude is the golden frame through which we see the meaning of life**

4. A weekly schedule that I could use to get healthier and actually stick would be.

### Raise Necessity

* Make it seem life this is a life or death scenario

#### Necessity Basics

##### Internal Forces:

* Identify (Personal Standards of Excellence and commitment = Excellence)
	* You need to ask yourself whether you are living to your high standards, and whether you need to increase your standards
	* These questions will be tough
	* The goal for all under performers must be to set new standards, self-monitor more frequently, and learn to become comfortable with taking a hard, unflinching look at their own performance.
* Obsession with topic/process
	* A certain degree of insanity and recklessness is necessary to advance or innovate anything, to make any new or remarkable or meaningful contributions
	* **When you are passionate about what you do, people understand. When you are obsessed, they think you're mad. Thats the difference.**
	* You need to make something your are doing necessary for you

External Forces:

* High performers view "positive" eternal forces as casual reasons for increased performance.
* There are two primary positive external forces that exert the kind of motivation or pressure that improves performance : Social Duty, Obligation, and Purpose
* High performers often feel the necessity to perform well out of a sense of duty to someone or something beyond themselves. Someone is counting on them, or they're trying to full fill a promise or responsibility.
* **When you have the opportunity to serve, you don't complain about the effort involved**
* Habits such as clarifying real deadlines are what make high performers effective.
* High performers are more focused on doing what really matters **When it matters**
* They always focused on their own deadlines.
* Most meet deadlines because they're excited to see their work out there in the world, as well as to move on to the next project or opportunity they have chosen for themselves.
* **When you choose to care for others and make a big difference in the world, the number of deadlines coming at you will increase**

Exercise One : Know who needs your A game

Set a desk trigger for yourself. Whenever your sit down at your desk, ask :

1. Who needs me on my A game right now
2. The reasons each of those people need me include..
3. The reasons I want to become a high performer for each of these people are
4. I know that i'm on my A game when I think, feel or behave
5. The things that throw me off my A game are...
6. I can deal more effectively with those things by
7. A few reminders I could set up for myself to be my best for the people in my life could include.

Exercise 2: Affirm the why

High performers confidently, and positively affirm their goals to themselves.

1. Three things I would like to become extraordinary at doing are....
2. My whys for become excellent in each of these areas are...
3. The people I will tell about these goals are the whys behind them include
4. The things I can say out load to affirm these whys- my affirmations-  are...
5. Some ways I can remind myself about these important goals and whys are...

Exercise 3: Level up Your Squad

High performers are more strategic and consistent in seeking to work with others at or above their level of competence, experience, or overall success.

1. Add one more awesome friend
2. Volunteer
3. Play sports
4. Seek mentorship
5. Earn it

##### External Forces


**The great mistake most people make is to think of balance in terms of evenly distributed hours.**

Its useful to organise yourself into ten distinct categories:

1. Health
2. Family
3. Friends
4. Intimate relations
5. Mission/Work
6. Finances
7. Adventure
8. Hobby
9. Spirituality
10. Emotion

You should strive to balance these areas out. Lacking in one area will cause problems.

**If you want to feel more energised, creative, and effective at work, and still leave work with enough ooph for the life part - The idea breakpoint is to stop your work and give your mind and body a break every 60 minutes.**

Aim to increase the output of the quality stuff.

Figuring out what you are supposed to produce, and learning the priorities in the creation, quality, and frequency of that output, is one of the greatest breakthroughs you can have in your career

Exercise: Ask yourself
PQO = Professional Quality output  - What brings you the most value

1. The outputs that matter most to my career are...
2. Some things I could stop doing so I can focus more on PQO are...
3. The percentage of my weekly time I will allocate to PQO is....

Its very important to keep a laser focus on what you want to do.

You need to plan complex tasks into small things.

**Becoming a high performer requires thinking before acting**

**If there were only 5 major moves to make that goal happen, what would they be?**

It does not matter whether you know how to achieve your five moves at first. The important thing is that for every major you have, you figure out the fives moves. If you don't know the moves, you lose

Exercise

1. The biggest goal or dream I have that I need to plan out right now is?
2. The five moves that would help me progress swiftly toward accomplishing that dream are?
3. The timeline for each of my five moves will be...
4. Fie people who have achieved that dream who I could study, seek out, interview, or model are...
5. The less important activities or bad habits I'm going to cut out of my schedule so that I can focus more time on the five moves in the net three months include?


**I believe the true road to permeant success in any life is to make yourself master in that line**

Not having the requisite skills to reach success in your field is a serious deficit.

Skill = Broad range of knowledge and capabilities that allow you to perform adequately in any given area.

You should determine the five major skills you need to develop over the next 3 years to grow into the person you hope to become

**Everything in trainable - not matter what skill you want to learn, with enough training and practice and intention, you can become more proficient at it.**

Repetition don't normally lead to high performance. Instead, think of progressive mastery

**Progressive mastery place a high emphasis on emotion, socialisation and teaching**

The steps to progressive mastery are:

1. Determine a skill that you want to master
2. Set specific stretch goals on your path to developing that skill
3. Attach high levels of emotion and meaning to your journey and your results
4. Identify the factors critical to success, and develop your strengths in those areas
5. Develop visualisations that clearly imagine what success and failure look like
6. Schedule challenging practices developed by experts or through careful thought
7. Measure your progress and get out-side feedback
8. Socialise your learning and efforts by practicing or competing with others
9. Continue setting higher level goals so that you keep improving
10. Teach others what you are learning.


Exercise


1. Three skills I could develop that would help me feel more confident or capable are...
2. The simple steps I could take to improve those skills include
3. The coaches or mentors I could seek out concerning those skills are....

### Influence

#### Influence Basics

Ask. You cant possibly know whether you have influence with your coworkers unless you ask them to do something. Same goes for spouse, so on.

If someone says yes to helping you, they tend to like you even more after they've done something for you.

Don't just ask once and quit, be persistent

Have a giving mindset. Enter almost every situation looking at ways you can help others.

Be proactive in seeking to give something to others, whether in meetings at work or while visiting someones home.

In organisations, the greatest thing you can give someone is trust, autonomy, and decision-making authority. (This is called authorship)

Display sincere appreciation for those you seek ti influence. Offer gratitude to them

Those who positively influence people do the following (The ultimate influence model):

1. They shape how you think by their example, lessons they impart of things they say to us.
2. They challenge us in some way. They call us out on our stuff, or they raise our ambitions to be better in our personal life, relationships, and contributions to the world
3. They **Serve as role models**

##### Teach People How to Think

When you communicate with others, think about:

* How do you want them to think about themselves?
* How do you want them to think about other people?
* How do you want them to think about the world large

The way you talk to them should demonstrate the way you want them to answer those three questions

##### Learning How to Think

Think of others as neighbours whom you should always give the benefit of the doubt and be help forward towards.

When in a hurry or disappointment meet their attitude, you should meet them with patience and humour.

Exercise:

1. Someone in my life I would like to influence more is...
2. The way I would like to influence them is...
3. If I could tell them how they should think of themselves, I would say...
4. If I could tell them how they should think of other people, I would say....
5. If I could tel them how they should think of the world in general, I would say....

##### Challenging People To Grow

High performers challenge the people around them to rise to higher levels of performance themselves.
They do this by issuing subtle or direct positively framed challenges to motivate others to excel.

You have to do this by speaking to them with respect and honour.

High performers strongly agree with the following statements:

1. I respond quickly to life's challenges and emergencies rather than avoiding them or delaying
2. I love trying to master new challenges
3. I'm confident I can achieve my goals despite obstacles or resistance.

High achievers challenge others characters - they give people feedback, direction, and high expectations for living up to universal values such as honesty, integrity, responsibility, self-control, patience, hard work, and persistence.

High achieves also challenge others on their connections with others. You set expectations, ask questions, give examples, or directly ask them to improve how they treat and add value to other people.

High achieves also challenge others contributions. You push them to add more value or to be more generous. Their challenging you by looking ahead - to create or innovate so that you make the future better.

### Demonstrate Courage

Courage is significantly correlated with high performance.
Sometimes it means taking a first step toward real change in an unpredictable world.


#### Courage Basics

The important thing is that you define what being courageous means to you, and start living that way

You are capable of remarkable things that you could never foretell and will never discover without taking action...
