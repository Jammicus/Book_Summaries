# 8 Steps to high performance - Focus on what you can change (ignore the rest)
## Introduction - How to be a high performer

* High performance will get you more of what you value, whether thats:
	* Flexibility
	* Power 
	* Opportunity
	* Pay
	* Recognition.
* Companies understand that high performers create and sustain successful companies, they’ll work hard to identify their best performers and give those outstanding employees more time, attention, development and compensation to make sure that they’re engaged and that they don’t leave
* Science says that high-performing employees deliver anywhere between 100% and 500% more output than their average or below average performing coworkers.
* As an employee, you should care about being a high performer because it gets you closer to your next promotion.
* Companies care about results -> Results = performance
* If you want to be a high perfomer, you need to be cautious consumer about claims other people make. 
* To assess whether a statement about high performance is believable, sort it into one of the 3 following categories, and decide which level of proof you require to believe a claim:
	* Research -> Done by companies, but often to support a product or service it sells. Findings may be true, but theres no independent verification, so it could be completely false
	* Science -> Someone conducts a carefully designed experiment to tested a hypothesis. They publish the research process and findings in a peer reviewed journal. Others can read about the experiment and draw their own conclusions
	* Conclusive science -> Other scientists conduct the same experiment described tens or hundreds of times. Almost every time, the result is the same. This indicates that the findings are conclusively true and at its strongest level of proof.

### The 8 Steps

* Conclusive science suggests eight steps that will help you be a high performer:
	1. Set big goals -> Goals have incredible power to focus and motivate us, more focus and motivation positions you for higher performance. 
	2. Behave to perform -> All behaviours are not created equal. There will  be behaviours you’re most likely to display, how to avoid going off the rails, and how to change your behaviors to the ones that drive high performance. You company will also value certain behaviors, which you need to identify.
	3. Grow yourself faster -> There is a optimal balance of experiences, education, and feedback that will accelerate your development. This is done through personal experience maps.
	4. Connect -> Who you knows matters, but, the strength of your relationship with them matters even more. 
	5. Maximise your fit -> You deliver your best work when your work environment “fits” you. You need to identify scenarios in which you fit best and how to change your fit to improve your performance
	6. Fake it -> Being a “fake” you sometimes is a better choice for high performance and how to adjust your behaviours to whats ideal for success at different points in your career 
	7. Commit your body -> Your body plays a powerful role in your ability to deliver, and its the only performance lever that you can completely control. Sleep, diet and exercise are very improtant.
	8. Avoid distractions -> How to avoid the performance fads that suggest easy answers to difficult performance questions that distracts you from the proven steps.



### What You Should Know about the Fix 50 Percent

* While the eight steps above will make you a high performer, there is a fixed 50% factors like personality which influences your behaviors and performance. These are:
	* Intelligence
	* Core perosnality
	* Body
	* Socioeconomic background

#### Your Intelligence

* This predicts 25% of your performance.
* Its the single largest predictor of performance, and its twice as powerful as any other element.
* If your IQ is in the high average range, (110-119 on an IQ test), you’re likely smart enough to be a high performer in many situations
* The average college graduate’s IQ is 115.

#### Your Core Personality 

* Your core personality is shaped by what you’ve experienced through your early twenties, and it can change slightly over time, but its largely set as you enter the working world. 
* The workaround to this is to correct your behaviors, eg, if your introverted, correct it so you are extroverted. However, at the heart of it, you’ll still be an introvert.

#### Your Body

* People who are tall as adolescents or adults have higher social esteem and performance, and earn an extra 1-2% of income for each additional inch they are above average.
* With more attractive people, they earn more and are seen as being more intelligent. 

#### Your Socioeconomic background

* One of the greatest predictors of your academic achievement; and it also predicts both future capabilities and the colleges and universities you’re most likely to attend.
* If you attend a highly ranked school, you’ll likely have higher-quality professor, more intelligent classmates, and a greater range of job opportunities after graduations than someone who attends a lower ranked school.

### On Becoming a High Performer: Things to Consider

* Other things to consider on your journey to high performance include:
	* Sacrifice and balance
	* High potential
	* Relative performance
	* Depending on yourself
	* Getting out your own way.

#### Sacrifice and Balance

* You can only achieve high performance when you have  a high performers mindset -> A mindset of competitive edge and self-sacrifice, and prioritising performance at work above your other options.
* The pursuit of high performance means that you try to maximise your success at work.
* High performers typically work more hours than average performers
* The additional time you invest at work creates a virtuous cycle ->more work means more learning has occured,s o that person becomes more capable and potentially a better contributor in the future. The more hours she works gets known in the origination, so she receives additional opportunities to show her skills. 
* When people say that they are more efficient than others at work, they often mention how they avoid social activities like chatting with others in the break room or how they frequently work from home to avoid distractions -> While this may make someone more efficient, they’re not building the important relationships they will need to succeed and advance in every organisation.
* If you accomplish the same amount of work in less time than your coworker, you’re not a high performer, you’re just efficient -> You have not delivered anything more than an average performer.
* More hours invested means more time that you can spend on all the steps to high performance -> Being efficient is great, but you still must do more and better than others to be a high performer
* High performance requires that you prioritise work performance over other activities. You can be flexible in how and where you apply these additional hours, but more hours, up to a point, are an essential ingredient  to high performance. 

#### High Performance Is Not High Potential 

* High performance != high potential
	* High performance -> Doing your job exceptionally well today
	* High potential -> being able to do bigger, more complex jobs tomorrow
* Being a high performer is a necessary threshold for being considered high potential, its just the first step.
* High performance today only predicts high performance tomorrow in similar situations (Eg, if you’re a good coder today, you will be a good coder tomorrow, but possibly not a good manager)

#### Depending On Yourself

* You and only you are accountable for your high performance.

#### Getting Out of Your Own Way

* Your brains core function is to ensure that you survive and, beyond its pursuit of food, shelter and a mate, it works hard to preserve your self-image and self-esteem.
* Its attempt to preserve these creates some challenging barriers to improving your performance, including:
	* Externalizing failure -> Blaming why you failed on something or someone else, rather than yourself
	* Mistakenly assigning intent to others action -> Can damage relationships and erode the interpersonal trust that supports our performance
	* Ignore information that can help you perform -> The brain only seeks out information that reinforces our self-image and ignores information that doesn’t. 

## Step 1: Set Big Goals

* Delivering big results is the heart of high performance, to do this you need big goals. 
* Bigger goals, focused on the right things, allow you to demonstrate higher performance. Bigger goals also test your capabilities and build self-confidence in your ability to deliver great results in the future. 

### What We Know

* The conclusive science on goal setting says:
	* Goals matter -> Your specific goal will create the focus and motivation that will produce bigger results than someone who simply tries their hardest.
	* Bigger goals increase what you deliver -> The theoretical maximum performance principle suggests that you can perform 20-40% above what you typically deliver.
	* Fewer goals mean higher achievement -> The power of goals comes from their ability to focus and motivate you, and having too many goals removes that focus.  Doings three things extremely well is better than struggling to achieve 6, 8 or 12
	* Coach toward the future -> Coaching combines feedback with direction - Heres what you’re doing today and heres how to do it better tomorrow. Feedback increases performance and the best results come when that feedback is about actives, not behaviors. (As feedback on activities does not conflict with their self image)

### What to Do

* Setting bigger goals ensure that what you plan to deliver is important enough for others to care about. 
* Your focus on bigger goals doesn’t mean that you should ignore important tasks or work less overall -> it means that you understand which tasks add the most value to your organisation.
* Many of you write goals as part of your company performance management process.
* There is a simple process to set goals that drive high performance:
	* Align
	* Prromise
	* Increase
	* Frame. 

### Align

* You can only be a high performer if you work on what your company values most, so you need to understand which company or department objectives are more important than others.
* If your instructions aren’t that clear, try this to get the right alignment:
	* Ask your management.
	* Research. Review your company, department or function strategy. Given your role, identify threee big things you can deliver that will most help to achieve the strategy. If strategy documents aren’t easily available, look at your company investor relations or “about’ websites. Theres almost always an executive presentation that describes the current years priorities. Review your findings with your manager.

### Promise

* Ask yourself “ What are the three big promises I will make to my organisation this year?”
	* This new framing shifts your thinking from things you need to do to what you’ll deliver. 
* In many companies, people set far more goals than the number of truly important things they need to accomplish.
* Tactics to choose fewer goals are:
	* Combine activities into the larger promises (Eg, if you have a goal of hire a developer, which is part of delivering a project, your promise should be delivering the project)
	* To prioritise promises. (Which of your promises has the most potential to meaningfully advance the progress against one of your company’s or departments objectives?)

### Increase

* To get closer to your theoretical maximum performance, you’ll need to increase what you promise (Remember, bigger goals deliver bigger results)
* Bigger doesn’t mean unrealistic or unachievable, but that you find a way to reimpose on your promise in one of these ways:
	* Speed -> You’ll get the project done earlier, the process to run faster, or the sales cycle to be shorter than it has been
	* Quality -> you’ll reduce the number of defects, increase the number of satisfied customers,  or improve the look or feel of the product by an amount that puts you among the worlds best at that activity
	* Cost -> You’ll sell a product or service for more, or you’ll reduce the cost of delivering it
	* Quantity -> You’ll sell, produce or ship more of the product
* The pivotal question, is how much will you improve one of these elements -> Ask yourself what it will take to be 20% better at any of the items listed, and increase/decrease if need be.
	* The difference must be enough so that your high performance will be meaningfully better than others and notice by those who care about your results.
* One great measure of a bigger goal: you should be a little scared about your ability to achieve it.

### Frame

* The way that succinctly tells your manager what you’re promising to achieve.
* most of us fail in this step by being too lengthy, complex and vague. 
* Use the SIMple goal concept:
	* Specific -> Describe the promise in 10 words or less
	* Important -> Each promise should help the organisation to deliver one of its most important objectives. Don’t include trivial goals or being tasks. if you limit yourself to three goals, its much easier to ensure each is important to the organisation 
	* Measurable -> There must be a way to assess whether you’ve achieved, exceeded, or fallen short of the goal. Quanititive goals are the easiest t measure, but many people work on projects or processes where the best measure is the quality or acceptance of the output.

### Get Coached

* You will find it easier to achieve your promises if you get clear direction and honest correction as you work on them.
* The ideal amount of coaching is similar to the spoken driving directions on your phone.
	* You get guidance before a critical turn that tells you to be ready and where to exit. You are rerouted if you go offtrack. Its not a stead stream of information, just the right directions delivered when they’re most needed.
* The author suggests 2+2 coaching, which you ask your manger to spend 15 minutes with you every three months for  a conversation that includes:
	* Two comments about your progress on your promises. (Two for all three promises) What are the most important observations or advice she has for you. The goal of her two comments is to make sure that you both are aligned about your progress
	* Two “feedforward” comments to enhance your performance or behaviours . Feedforward comment could be like “In next weeks presentations, keep them short and focused”. When you hear feedforward advice, you still get specific guidance for how to improve, but without being criticised for things that have already happened. 
	
### What Can Get In the Way

* My manager set my goals for me. -> Review those goals and suggest changes to your mange if the goals aren’t fewer, bigger, and aligned or don’t meet the SIMple criteria 
* My job is routine, where I do the same things each day -> Anything that you can do can be done better
* My manager insists that I have more than three goals -> Let him know that you want to focus on the most important things, tell him the three goals you believe are the most important, and ask if the he agrees.
* My manager isnt an expert in goal setting -> Share the book with him
* How do I get credit for doing my day job if its not in my goals -> You get credit for doing your day job through your regular pay check. Goals exist to focus your efforts and energy to achieve something above and beyond what you typically do
* My goals change all the time during the year -> Check whether your goals meet the definition of a larger promise or if they sound more like activities. A promise shouldn’t change very often, even if some of the tactics require to achieve do.
* What if I set big goals and fail -> This is where high performers separate themselves from others. High performers want to take appropriate risk to prove that they can overachieve. You will on occasion fall short of a goal. You will, over time, deliver more great results than your peers and be recognised as a higher performer

### Remember And Apply:

#### Conclusive science says:
* Goals matter, you’ll perform better if you have them
* Eliminate tactical activities from your goals; move them to a project plan
* Ask your manager to regularly use 2+2 coaching with you to ensure you’re on the path to high performance on your goals

#### You should

* Create your three big promises that will differentiate you as a high performer
* Eliminate tactical activities from your goals; move them to a project plan
* Ask your manager to regularly use 2+2 coaching with you to ensure you’re on the path to high performance on your goals

#### Try using:

* Goal setting form in the appendix of this book.


## Step 2: Behave to Perform


### Why It Matters

* Behaviours help you differentiate yourself as a high performer because they prove that you can do more than just get things done. 
* They’re responsible for 15% to 40% of your total performance, depending on your role. 
* Behaviours may or may not be what actually drives performance, but they signal what your leaders pay attention to. 
* You can assume that everyone you work with evaluates your behaviours every ay and interacts with you based on their impressions. 

### How it Works

* The science about how behaviour drives performance says that you’ll be a higher performer if you:
	* Understand yourself. You know how you typically behave and how that affects your performance. 
	* Choose the right behaviours. You know which behaviours are most likely to make you a high performer
	* Adapt quickly. You know how to quickly and easier show performance-driving behaviours 

### Understand Yourself 

* The way you behave is a combination of how your personality guides you to behave and how you choose to behave.

* Personality is largely set by your late teens, but this does not mean that you cannot control your behaviours. 
* For example if you’re a little edgy in meetings, you can smile more and ask questions to understand another’s point of view, rather than reacting too quickly to their comments. 
* High performers understand that different parts of your personality influence behaviours in different ways. 
* A persons personality is made up of  “the big 5”
![](8%20Steps%20to%20high%20performance%20-%20Focus%20on%20what%20you%20can%20change%20(ignore%20the%20rest)/Screen%20Shot%202018-09-09%20at%2011.47.26.png)
* (There is a item in the appendix for you to do)
* Conscientiousness is the personality factor that most influences your performance -> its twice as powerful as any other factor.
* If you’re naturally wired to focus one results, be disciplined and pursue tasks, you’re likely to be a higher performer than someone who must work hard to ignore distractions and force themselves to buckle down.
* Emotional Stability is slightly helpful in every role as obviously, people want o interact with you more when you’re predictable and calm.
* The other personality factors are not necessarily important to your performance, but its helpful to understand how your personality naturally pulls you in certain directions.

### Choose the Right Behaviours

* We are going to assume you ave ethical, honest and fair. 
* If you violate these baseline behaviours, you will never be a sustained high performer. Any temporary success you gain from bad behaviours will pale in comparison to the shame of getting caught, getting fired, or going to jail.
* There is good news, research tells you which behaviours should make you a higher performer
* Bad news, the behaviours that matter change, depending on how you define performance. 

#### Behaviour Option 1 : Behave like a Transformation Leader

* People who behave as transformation leaders are consistently rated higher on their teams motivation, satisfaction and their own leadership effectiveness than those who lead in any other way.
* Transformational leaders to the following well:
	* Connect: Show genuine concern for employees; they’re able to personally connect with them even if they dont directly manage them
	* Innovate: Push their team to create novel solutions and take risks
	* Inspire: Offer a compelling vision and encourage employees to perform at higher levels
	* Model : Act consistently with their vision and the goals they’ve set for others.
* Transformational leadership behaviours aren’t very influenced by your core personality, so no one has a natural advantage over you in being a transformational leader.
* If you need to pull others along, transformational leadership is a great model. However, if you need to push them forward, you may want to consider the science about being a performance driver.

#### Behaviour Option 2: Behave Like a Performance Driver
* If you are high up the work chain (Eg, CEO, CTO so on), this is a good option
* The behaviours that work in heated, performance-obsessed environment were found to fall into two categories
	* General ability (Aggressive, persistent, proactive…) ->  Getting things done
	* Interpersonal ( Team player, open to criticism…) -> Working well with others
* Performance driving people show the following:
	* General ability:
		* Fast
		* Aggressive
		* Persistent
		* Efficient
		* Proactive
		* High Standard
	* Interpersonal:
		* Respectful
		* Open to criticism
		* Good listening skills
		* Teamwork
* These categories are not mutually exclusive, they found that CEO’s that were most successful were high on general ability and low on interpersonal 
* The behaviours in the general ability category sound very much like the ones that define the personality factor of conscientiousness and are scientifically prove to improve performance. 
* Remember, if you are high up the chain, you are far less concerned that you get along with others and far more concerned that you get stuff done. 
* Author suggests both great results and great interpersonal behaviours are essential ingredients for high performance.

### Adapt Quickly 

* If behaviours are your secret weapon for high performance, the first steps to know how well armed you are. 
* Are your behaviours consistent with your preferred model? Do you have any derailing behaviours that will likely throw you offtrack? 
* “Ten-item personality inventory” in the appendix can help you understand your natural tendencies. 
* What is key here is how your boss, coworkers, and direct reports perceive your behaviours. 
* You should also care about what others think because your view of your performance and behaviours is the least accurate one. 
* There are two ways  to find out how others perceive us
	* Ask them directly
	* Ask them indirectly

#### Ask Directly

* Asking others directly about your performance and behaviours isnt as scary as it sounds. 
* Remember the mindset that everyone can get better at something. 
* Your goal when you ask someone directly is to get a suggestion or two for how to behave even better, not to get comprehensive assessment of you. 
* An approach called “feedforward” makes others giving you insights about what yo change and make you feel comfortable receiving them.
* In feedforward -> Ask a few people you trust how you can be a higher performance in the future. 
* The key is that its about feedback to be better in the future, not feedback about the past. 
* To make the process work best:
	* Use it with people you know well, who you know will feel comfortable sharing their thoughts.
	* Don’t surprise them with the question. Ask them over a cup of coffee or as part of another conversation
	* Follow up , once you have tried their suggestions let them know that it worked and you appreciate the feedback.

#### Ask Indirectly 

* This is where you use the approach of a 360-degree assessment to get similar insights.
* In a typical 360-degree assessment process, your manager, some peers , some direct reports, and possibly a few others rate you on a set of  behaviours. 
* They rate you as being good or bad at those behaviours or assess how frequently you show them. 
* Their answers combine into a report that summaries their assessment of you and possible compares the scores against some reference or benchmark.
* The next step once you have the report back separates those who improve from those who don’t. Set up a action meeting with each of the people who did the report with a action plan to improve and to ask for their advice
* In the meeting, say :
	* What you did “I recently went through a 360-degree assessment process to help ensure I’m a strong performer. I dont know who participated, so I’m meeting with everyone who was invited so I can share my action plan and get any additional advice you may have for me
	* What you heard “ There was a lot of helpful information in the report about things I do well and things I need to approve I wasp lasted to here [insert 2 good things]. I also heard that people would like me to improve in [inseert to things]
	* What you plan is.
	* What is their advice “ Do you have any suggestions for how I can improve in the areas I mentioned.
	* When you have finished listening, say thank you.

### Which Behaviours Can Hurt You

* Some behaviours are likely to give you a performance advantage, but some of those same behaviours can hurt your performance if they’re turned up too high and become overdone strengths. They become “Derailers”
* These derailing behaviours might have served you well over time, but now they’re an anchor that drags behind you an slows your progress. 
* Everyone has detailers, including high performers, so the secret is to recognise which ones you have and work hard to keep them in check. 
* This is also a key reason not to focus on your strengths when you plan your development. If you overemphasis your strengths, they can become detailers. 
* There are 11 Different ways our behaviours can derail our performance.
* There is a quick assessment to better understand your potential detailers and what they will happen if you dont correct them:

#### The Eleven Detrailers


* Excitable -> Being overly enthusiastic about, and then disappointed with, people or projects
	* Consequece : Seems to lack persistence
* Skeptical -> being socially insightful, but cynical and overly sensitive to criticism:
	* Consequence: Seems to lack trust
* Cautious -> Being overly worried about being criticised:
	* Consequence: Seems resistant to change and reluctant to take chances
* Reserved -> Lacking interest in or awareness of the feelings of others
	* Consequence: Seems to be a poor communicator
*  Leisurely -> Being independent, ignoring others requests, and become irritable if they persist
	* Consequence: Seems stubborn, procrastinating, and uncooperative
* Bold -> Having inflated views of ones competency and worth
	* Consequence : Seems unable to admit mistakes or learn from the experience   
* Mischievous -> Being charming, risk taking and excitement seeking
	* Consequence: Seems to have trouble maintaining commitments and learning from experience 
* Colorful -> Being dramatic, engaging, and attention seeking
	* Consequences : Seems preoccupied with being noticed and may lack sustained focus
* Imaginative -> Thinking and acting in interesting, unusual and even eccentric ways
	* Consequence: Seems creative but possibly lacking in judgement
* Diligent -> Being conscientious, a perfectionist, hard to please
	* Consequence: Tends to disempower staff
* Dutiful -> Being ear to please and reluctant to act independently
	* Consequence: Tends to be pleasant and agreeable, but reluctant to support  subordinates

#### Detailer mini-assent

For each of the statements listed below, mark whether the statement generally describes you (y) or does not (n)

* Excitable -> I have been so frustrated with projects that I gave up
* Skeptical -> I know who my enemies are
* Cautious -> I live by the rule “better safe than sorry”
* Reserved -> I like to keep people guessing about my interactions
* Leisurely -> I am smarter than my boss
* Bold -> Someday people will appreciate my talent
* Colorful -> I enjoy being the life of the party
* Mischievous -> I can persuade others to do almost anything
* Imaginative -> Others are often amazed by my creativity
* Diligent -> I tend to be a perfectionist
* Dutiful -> I take pride in being a good organisational citizen 

Scoring: If you answered a question with a  (y), its likely you’ll show this derailed to others at least periodically.

* You must identify your derailers and prevent yourself from exhibiting them  


### Make Behaviours Work in your company.

* We showed the two key behaviour models earlier, but many companies have their own model (leadership model, values model).
* That model is your company statement that certain behaviours matter more there than others.
* Consider the following questions:
	* How Important are these behaviours to your ultimate success -> Just because this behaviour model exists and is listed in your performance evaluation doesn’t mean it will affect your success. you should care most about the behaviours that affect your pay, your performance rating, or your ability to move forward in the company. 
	* Which behaviours matter most? The best way to find out is to ask your manger questions such as:
		* Which three behaviours in this model matters most?
		* which behaviours does the CEO care most about?
		* Which behaviours do high-potential leaders here show to you most frequently?
		
###  What can get in the way.

* My company doesn’t have a behaviour model. What should I use to guide my behaviours -> Ask your manager which three behaviours will make you a high performer or start with the transformational leader or performance driver models described earlier in this chapter.
* My manger says on thing about which behaviours matter and my company says something else. Who should I believe? -> If the companies behaviour model is used to determine your performance, help you develop, or assess you for promotion, then thats the model to follow.
* Behaviours dont matter at my company -> Just because behaviours aren’t hardwired into your company practices doesn’t mean that they dont matter. Your company culture will send strong signals about which behaviours matter most. Ask your manager and/or few people you consider high performers for their opinion about which behaviours high performers in your company show
* How can I fix my detailers -> Since your detailers aren’t part of your core personality, you can’t permanently fix them, but you can learn to recognise and control them.

### Remember and Apply 

* The conclusive science says:
	* Your personality provides a baseline for your behaviours but not an excuse; you control how you behave
	* You can predict which behaviours are likely to derail your career and start to correct them today
	* Some people are born with personality characteristics that give them a natural performance advantage in some situations
* You should
	* Understand your baseline personality and how you’re naturally oriented to behave.
	* Identify which behaviours are most important for your success in your current environment and list three specific activities it will take to improve them
	* Know your derails and have a plan to recogniser when they might show and how to keep them hidden
* Try using:
	* Ten-tiem personality inventory
	* Detailer mini assessment above

## Step 3: Grow Yourself Faster

### Why it Matters

* You compete every day against every individual in your company or industry who wants to be a high performer. 
* if you grow more capabilities more quickly than they do, you’ll perform better today and earn more opportunities to perform better in the future. 
* If you effectively apply your new learnings, you’ll advance faster and more successfully than your peers.
* Most executives understand that better quality talent delivers better business results.
* They’ll search for that rare talent, pay them well, and give them more opportunities to continue their development. 
* Every minute you aren’t growing your capabilities, you’re losing your competitive advantage to someone who’s working hard to grow theirs. 

### What We Know

* The more you grow in the right areas the more likely you are to be a high performer. 
* When you grow, you build crystallised intelligence - more useful content in your brain - giving you more facts, insights and observations that you can use to deliver better results.
* You need to remember the “70/20/10” mantra. Which stands for:
	* 70% of your professional growth will come from the work experiences you have
	* 20 percent welcome from your interactions with others
	* 10 percent will come from formal education. 
![](8%20Steps%20to%20high%20performance%20-%20Focus%20on%20what%20you%20can%20change%20(ignore%20the%20rest)/Screen%20Shot%202018-09-09%20at%2012.55.37.png)


### Grow Faster

* Think of growth as a cycle - perform, get feedback, perform again better.
* The faster and more often you move through that cycle, the faster you’ll develop and get the next opportunity to learn a new skill, test a new behaviour, and get more helpful feedback
* Each cycle you move through should make you more competent and more competitive. 
![](8%20Steps%20to%20high%20performance%20-%20Focus%20on%20what%20you%20can%20change%20(ignore%20the%20rest)/Screen%20Shot%202018-09-09%20at%2012.57.35.png)

* To grow faster, you must understand which development activities matter most and o as many of them as quickly as possible.
* You need to be very clear about your desired destination on that development journey
* The three steps to grow faster are:
	* Determine your from/to
	* Get the exerpeinces and create a personal experience map
	* Get feedback an feedforward on your capabilities and behaviours


### Determine your From/To

* Most people slow their own growth because they aren’t clear about their development path
* Whether you use your company individual development process or create a development plan on your own, you need to be precise and brutally honest with yourself about your origin and destination.
* Use the from/to technique.
* The from/to technique is two brief statements, one describing where you are today, and one describing your next big (not your ultimate) destination. 
* Both statements should be direct , honest and specific.
* When you read your from.to statements, you should be clear about which developmental step to take next.

![](8%20Steps%20to%20high%20performance%20-%20Focus%20on%20what%20you%20can%20change%20(ignore%20the%20rest)/Screen%20Shot%202018-09-09%20at%2013.05.45.png)

* You’ll get a praise from/to once you have input from others.
* Your company most senior leaders should guide your from/to because its their opinions, not those of your peers or direct reports, that will decide how you progress in the organisation
* To get their direction:
	* Identify who to ask. Choose your manager and two or three other senior leaders who you’ve worked with or who know your performance
	* Request their insights. Introduce the from_to concept to them, send them the form_to examples and ask them to thin about your to/from.
	* Develop your from_to statement. Use their input to create your final from_to. Which of their statements eem most direct and make you most uncomfortable? Which set the “to” far enough away so that it will be a meaningful challenge to achieve. Whose opinion do you trust the most? Use their statements as raw material and practice writing a few different from/to versions.

### Get Experiences and Create Your personal experience Map

* As experiences best accelerate your development, you should regularly ask yourself “What next experience will most quickly move my career in the desired direction?” 
* An experience is what you achieve when you deliver a high-quality outcome to a meaningful challenge. You may have to use many different skills and behaviours to deliver that outcome, but its your ability to combine those together to deliver a result that creates an experience
	* Eg “Create marketing strategy for a new line of business” is an experience. 
* Experiences are your largest development tool, so you’ll want to understand which will build your acreer and, more importantly, the few, most powerful experiences that can close your from/to gap. 
* A regularly updated personal experience map should become your career guide.
* Personal experience map shows which experiences you want to acquire in the next 3-7 years to accelerate your career. 
* Its a practical planning document that describes how you will produce the highest-performing you. “Production” is the mindset you should have. 
* Each experience you have helps manufacture you into a more capable, confident, high performer.
* There are two key experiences which will accelerate your development:
	* Functional experiences -> Help make you great at something. Allows you to prove you are highly competent at what you do.
	* Management experiences. -> Help you to prove that you can perform or manage in a variety of challenging situations.
* When you successfully achieve these challenging experiences, you prove to your company that you’re a versatile leader who deserves a chance for larger, more important roles.

![](8%20Steps%20to%20high%20performance%20-%20Focus%20on%20what%20you%20can%20change%20(ignore%20the%20rest)/Screen%20Shot%202018-09-09%20at%2013.20.14.png)

### Creating your Personal Experience map

#### Interview Experts In Your Field

* Identify the best experts. Ideally, you want to interview the best in your field, not the best in your company or country. 
	* Find the leaders on industry “Best lists” from their articles in trade magazines, on lists of speakers at relevant conferences, or from referrals of leaders in your company
	* Request an interview. Email each later, framing your request as a casual conversation ins which they can help someone in the field develop. (See book for template example,)
	* Ask for insights. Ask the following:
		* What are the key functional experiences that you believe will produce the highest-quality [insert your role here]
		* Describe what you would see on the resume of someone who is outstanding at X.
	* Dont forge tao tank them! 

#### Create your own Personal Experience Map.

* Your interviews will provide your ith raw material to create your personal experience Map.
* Your goal is to sort through this information to find the few experiences that will most accelerate your career.
* An experience should describe a meaningful business output - Open a new production facility, lead a large team through a business turnaround, or close books for a business unit. 
* It should be a significant building block of your functional or leadership capability; your accomplishment of it shouldn’t be something to others in your field. 
* Differences between experiences and behaviours or skills:

![](8%20Steps%20to%20high%20performance%20-%20Focus%20on%20what%20you%20can%20change%20(ignore%20the%20rest)/Screen%20Shot%202018-09-09%20at%2013.26.22.png)

* The functional experiences you need to be a high performer will be unique to your profession, but the management experiences will be very similar across profesions.
* Management experiences grow generic capabilities that are valuable to all mangers, no matter their function.
* Personal Experience Map example:
![](8%20Steps%20to%20high%20performance%20-%20Focus%20on%20what%20you%20can%20change%20(ignore%20the%20rest)/Screen%20Shot%202018-09-09%20at%2013.28.20.png)


* Life cycle experiences -> Lead in different parts of your company or product evolution. Lead in a turnaround situation, lead a startup, manage in a steady-state environment…
* Managing experiences -> Lead in environments where your managerial skills are tested. Upgrade a poor quality team, lead a large team, manage a team where you have influence but not authority, lead in a mantrixed environment, lead in a highly political environment.
* Geographic experiences: Have exerpiences outside your home geography, where the local language is not your local language.

* Select the four to seven function experiences and three to four management experiences you believe will benefit you most and record them on your person experience amp. 
* The map should be focused and realistic - a reference sheet that you’ll use regularly to plan your growth and assess your progress
* The personal experience amp is now your guide to continuously grow your high-performing self. Creating it will be one of your best investments of time. 
* Review the content of your map any time you switch jobs or companies and at least every 6 months to ensure that it remains a current, helpful guide.

#### Get Feedback and Feedforward

* Your great experiences only matter if you treat them as learning opportunities form which you squeeze every ounce of feedback insight.
* At the end of each experience, meet with the person who gave you the experience (Eg, your manager), for a structured de-brief.
* Ask them:
	* “In additional to delivering results, what did you hope I would learn from this experience? Do you believe I learned none, some, or all of that?”
	* “Based on my performance, what advice would you have for me in similar types of experiences?”
	* “ Could you give me one other suggestion for how I can be a better performer going forward?”
	
#### Work With Your Company development process.

* Many companies have an annual process in which you and your manager plan your development.
* Your personal experience map should be your primary career guide and supplment your company plan.
* To ensure that you get what you need from your company development process, do the following:
	* Understand your managers “One thing”. Ask  your boss “What one thing can i change this year to be a higher performer than last year?” that answer should become your main goal in your company individual development plan.
	* Lead with your personal experience map. Your manager is not a development expert, and you shouldn’t expect him or her to have perfect insights into your development. Give a suggestion from your map and see if they agree or disagree. 
* Sometimes managers development suggestions will be a tactical step they would like to see you take, such as attend a training course.
* In those cases, agree to their suggestion, while also asking them to support the experience you seek as part of your experience map. 
* As you plan how to grow, keep these truths in mind :
	* You manger is not a development expert. Managers are often tasks with creating their employees’ development plans, so you might assume they re highly skilled int act area. Remember your manager is not an expert in development. They should be one source of input, not there only source for your personal development plan
	* Your company formal development process may not be enough. You may not want to outsource your success to your employer but take personal responsibility for it instead. Participate in your company process, but recognise that your real development plan should be the one you keep, update, and use to tract your professional growth.

### Wrapping up

* You become a high performer with great results and the right behaviours.
* You remain a high performer by continually growing your capabilities and skills to position yourself for bigger more challenging, and more career-building exercises.
* Surest way to grow yourself faster is to successfully complete as many of the eight functional and hangmen experiences as you can, as quickly as you can. 

### What Can Get In Your Way

* My company wants me to take an assignment outside my home country, but I’m unsure its the right thing to do -> A move outside your home country will be one of the most powerful development experiences in your career. 
* Shouldn’t a development plan include behaviours and skills? -> Behaviours and skills matter tremendously, and in your experiences, you will gain new skills and practice new behaviours. If you want to develop a specific skill or behaviour, determine which experiences will most effectively teach it to you
* My company has a competency or behaviour model that it says I should use for devleopment. What is  that and how do I connect these with experiences -> Competency model can describe either behaviours your company wants you to demonstrate or capabilities it believes are important for your function. They are useful, it doesn’t tell you how to build the competencies. Experiences are the quickest way to build competencies.
* If formal education is only 10 percent of learning, should i attend any courses that my company offers -> Formal course work helps provide frameworks, tools, and the opportunity to discuss or practice concepts before implanting them. Formal education can be very valuable. Be sure that you’re not substituting a course for the learning that you could obtain through experience
* My company doesn’t seem to prioritise experiences as a way to grow. -> Guide your manager to help you get the experiences on your personal experience map. The conversation with him should describe:
	* The benefits your manager of company will receive, that is, “I will be able to do x for you that I can’t do now”, “I will be able to train others on this”, “The company will get more of x or y from me”
	* How you plan to succeed in the experience  “I will use these skills, learn these new capabilities, demonstrate these behaviours, get this type of feedback to correct my course”
* I work in a small company, and I can’t get much experience -> Remember that experiences aren’t jobs. They are opportunities to build your skills by delivering or doing something that you haven’t delivered or done before. With that definition, are there other experiences that your company offers? There’re are always special projects. Will one o them help? Can you shadow someone?

### Remember and Apply

#### The research says

* As working professions, we grow our capabilities about 70% through our experience, 20% through others, and 10% through formal learning
* You’ll get the most from experiences if they include challenges that are diverse (geographic, life cycle, management) and adverse ( you must solve new problems to succeed in them)

#### You should

* Create your personal experience map by asking experts in your field to identify the most meaningful experiences to gain
* Write and maintain your individual development plan - your lifetime guide for how you will achieve high performance
* Regularly evaluate if you’re having the most powerful learning experience you can change quickly if not. 

#### Try using

* Personal experience map above.


## Step 4: Connect

### Why It Matters

* Science show that influencing and connecting strategies are amazingly effective to get what you need from superiors and peers.
* The research says:
	* Integrate yourself and everything works better. IF you ingratiate yourself with others, you will benefit in every typical work scenario.
	* Relationships an supplement weak performance. Poorly performing employees who have strong relationships with their managers get higher performance ratings despite their objectively low performance.
	* You move as fast as your boss does. Your positive relationship with your manager improves your promotion changes, and employees get promoted faster when their manager gets promoted faster
	* Big network, big results. Those with stronger networks have higher salaries, more promotions over their careers, and greater career satisfaction. Its not just who you know, but how many you know as well.
* Science also tells us that your personality and political skills directly affect your ability to connect and influence, inlcuding:
	* The context predicts who connects best. Both introverts and extroverts can connect effectively, but who they connect with will depend on the context. Introverts are more influential in technical settings where their primary focus is to work on tasks. Extroverts are more influential in team-based environments where their natural interest in connecting gives them an advantage 
	* Connectors are far more positive. Those who connect well have higher self-confidence, job satisfaction, belief in the organisation, commitment, productivity, positive behaviours, career success, and personal reputation
	* Political animals have an advantage. Your ability to master good politics makes you more effective because political environments make many people unhappy, less committed, more stressed, an wanting to leave the origination. Those who can master a more political environment have a distinct performance advantage over those who can’t
	* Your peers will keep you in check. Integration works well with your boss, but remember that your peers will see you play that game. If they think you’re trying too hard or too obviously to build that connection, it can harm your reputation and network. The more you might benefit from the relationship with your manager, the more risk your behaviours pose to your reputation and relationships with your peers.

### What to do

* You should develop and actively implement a strategy to connect better with your manager, peers, and subordinates, and with your external network.
* Each connection provides unique benefits but requires  a different strategy to succeed

### Connect with your manager

* Your immediate manager is your most critical work relationship.
* Your priority activity should be to build a close, productive relationship with him or her.
* You do this by doing the following

#### Perform

* If you consistently deliver great results, you build the foundation for a great relationship with your boss. 
* probably the most important
* Your high performance makes her look good and reduces the effort she needs to spend managing you, so its a double with for her.

#### Help Deliver What Matters

* You boss wants to look good. To make her look good, is to know what will  make her look good and help her achieve this
* The easiest way to determine this is to ask “Whats on your agenda right now? Or “Whats the one deliverable, project, or metric that you really want to ace this year or quarter?”
* Once you know her concerns, identify and offer specific ways you can help. Give options for how you can support her. 
* Put conscious effort into asking your boss that question and following up afterward. You will possibly be the only one who does this, which makes this approach even more effective. 
* Even if your manger says no the first time, ask regularly. You’ll get credit for your positive intentions.

#### Flatter

* No matter how humble we think we are, its amazing how much we like to hear others praise our capabilities and accomplishments.
* Flattery can be “Great presentation” or “you seem to really know whats going on around here”.
* While its theoretically possible to go overboard, science says that even when people know we’re false in our flattery, they’ll still feel good about it and us.

#### Offer Genuine Personal Friendship.

* Most obvious way to build a strong relationship with your boss is to become your bosses friend.
* You build that friendship as you would any other, through regular contacts, trusting actions, listening and acting selfless.
* Pay attention yo your boss’s personal interests as well, and if they mention something regularly, ask about it.
	* Dont however fake expertise in her favourite interest though, you will lose huge amounts goodwill if you say you love Formula One when you hate it. 

### Connect With your peers

* Peers play a unique role in your quest to be a high performer because they have no direct power over your success but significant influence.
* There are 4 things that will help you connect

#### Know Them Well

* you’ll understand how to best connect with your peers when you know them well. 
* You should call, o have lunch, beer, coffee or any other meaningful connection with every key peer at least once a quarter. 
* This is a scheduled “Hey I’d love to catch up” sit down meeting with the goal of understanding whats going now ith them at work and perhaps at home. 

#### Connect More With The Best

* Your reputation depends on your relationships with many peers, but your future is more influenced by your relationships with your high-performing peers.
* Those high performers may be competing for the same promotion or resources as you. That makes it important to show that you dont have the proverbial knife behind your back and that you’ll be either  good boss or a direct report, depending on who gets promoted.
* You boss also likely trusts your highest-performing peers, so when they talk to him about you, their comments willl matter more than comments from a low-performing peer. 
* You’re known by the company you keep, so would you rather be seen as a compatriots of the best talent or  of average talent

#### Say Yes

* Theres a powerful psychological concept called the norm of reciprocity. 
	* It says that we’re hardwired to want to help someone if they help us. 
	* Use this to your benefit by saying yes when your peers request help, especially your high-performing peers. 
	* This may include lending them a resource to directly support a project to even throwing a few budget dollars to them when they’re in need.

#### Ask for Help and Advice

* People are flattered when you ask for their opinions.
* Even if you have a perfectly thought-out strategy, plan, or document, ask some key peers for input. 
* This works especially well if theres something in your plans that might conflict with theirs or you’re working in an area where they are also and expert. 

### Connect With Your Subordinates 

* The unique factor about connecting with your direct reports is that you already have power and organisational authority over them, so its helpful to mange these relationships, but its not as essential as managing the relationships with your mangers or peers.


###  Build Your External Network

* You will be a higher performer when you build strong networks inside and outside your organisation.
* That strong network gives you more access to valuable information (Whats happening in the industy; who’s important to know), more resources, and more people who can actively sponsor and support your career.
* Your broad networks extend your reach to people who can advance your careers, connect you with important contacts, and informally coach you to success. 
* You can build those networks through personal connections made at events, conferences, professional association gatherings, coffees, lunches and dinners.
* For introverts, there a few thoughts to keep in mind:
	* Everyone loves to talk about themselves. People are naturally egocentric and often happy to share those details about themselves instead. Your job is to memorise five questions that will keep any conversation going. 
		* Where they are originally
		* Where did they work before their current employer
		* Vacation plans for this year
		* What they like to do outside work
	* People want to help you if its easy or in their self-interest. People connect partly for the political benefits, and an essential part of politics is to return favours. 
	* Make the connection easy for them by going to their office or a coffee shop near them, schedule the meeting for no more than thirty minutes, and request nothing from them except to say in touch in the future.
	* They notice you less than you think. If you’re nervous that you might say or do something embarrassing in a long conversation with a new colleague or networking contact, realise that others dont notice unique things about us as we may think.
* To Build a strong foundation with your connections:

#### Have a purpose and be purposeful

* You’ll find it much easier to crete your networking plan once you’re clear on your purpose for networking
* Once your clear on your purpose, develop a plan:
	* How many contacts do you need to make?
	* Over what period of time?
	* In what industries or locations?
	* How many real connections (Meetings and calls, not LinkedIn Contacts) will make every month?
	* How will you evaluate your success?

#### Be Strategic, not all contacts are equal

* You want to meet with the most powerful, highest-ranking, prominent, well-respected contacts that you can.
* In your casual networking, its fine to meet the supply chain directory from the local factory. 
* If your purpose is to accelerate your career growth, the most powerful individuals will have the most influence. 
* As with other contacts, invite them for coffee, lunch or dinner with a clearly stated purpose - to better understand the industry learn from their career experiences, and so on. Say nice things about their accomplishments. Express interest in their interests. 

#### Become the Network

* If theres no network that meets your needs, start one.

#### Use External Consultants as Connectors.

* In any field there are external consultants who will regularly knock on your door to sell you a product or service.
* Start thinking of consultants as people who can help you connect

### Build Your Assessment

* The connection planning sheet can help you track key relationships :
![](8%20Steps%20to%20high%20performance%20-%20Focus%20on%20what%20you%20can%20change%20(ignore%20the%20rest)/Screen%20Shot%202018-09-09%20at%2019.05.35.png)

### What Can Get In the Way

* I feel uncomfortable asking someone a level above me in my company to coffee or lunch -> You need to actively build relationships with people at the level above you. They will make decisions about your career, and the better they know you, the more positive those decisions are likely to be. 
* I can’t spend that much time connecting, who should I prioritise? -> Your manger and your two or three highest-performing peers. outside your company, connect with the most influential person in your field. 
* Shouldn’t I spend more time connecting with my direct reports? -> You’ll naturally interact with your direct reports as their manager, but you might not naturally spend time with your peers or boss. 

### Remember and Apply

#### The Science Says

* Extroverts are more natural connectors but dont have higher-quality networks than  introverts
* Those with larger networks have higher salaries, more promotions and greater satisfaction during their careers
* People are most interested in connecting when there are obvious benefits for them, but typically will positively respond to your request ue to the norm of reciprocity

#### You Should

* Establish a strong relationship with your boss thats based both on your excellent performance and on an active strategy to help them perform well and look great to others
* Identify your highest-performing peers and build a strong relationship with each by understanding their needs, helping them where possible, and engaging in social behaviour like having coffee or lunch with them
* Identify the most influential people in your field and build relationships with a few of them by showing that you’re a loyal follow and want to help them be oven more successful 

#### Try using:

* Connection planning sheet.


## Step 5: Maximise Your Fit 


### Why It Matters

* When your capabilities are aligned with the organisations needs, you can produce wonderful results.
* Fit matters because companies change as they respond to their markets and customers, as their products mature, or as they find new business opportunities. 
* Since companies change faster than people change, great performers can become average performers overnight when their company changes the definition of  “greaT”
* High performers continually adjust and maximise their fit with their company. 
* They know that their ability to quickly shift their behaviours to align with new strategies and changed needs makes them more versatile, valuable, and more likely to get opportunities to demonstrate even more high performance.

### What We Know. 

* People who fit with an organisation deliver better results because they’re more satisfied with their jobs and more committed to the company.
* Science suggests that two key ways people fit are with a companies strategy and with the amount of change the company needs
* “strategy” -> How your company plans to beat the competition
* Change -> The level of turmoil you’ll need to mange as it does that
* These two elements also evolve regularly at your company, and its evolution is why actively manning your fit is necessary

### What you Contribute to Fit

* You have a preferred way of working and preferred type of company to work in.
* You might love the fast-paced, frenetic, risky environment of a small, high-growth firm. 
* You might enjoy the stability, professionalism and predictable environment of a  well-established, large firm.
* You may have a preference between the two, but you can adapt to a somewhat different environment if needed. 

### What your Company contributes to fit

* Your company has a culture, a strategy and a preference for how it gets work done.
* These factors create the environment that you must fit within. 
* That pace of change means that you have to change when the company decides its strategy requires new behaviours or capabilities. 

### What to do

* If you regularly assess your company changing needs, you can shift your capabilities and behaviours to better align with them.
* The assessments requires that you:
	* Understand your companies changing needs
	* Understand where you naturally fit
	* Manage your fit to maximise your performance

### Understanding your Company’s changing needs

* As your company strategy and change needs evolve, the capabilities that define high performance will evolve as well.
* The more accurately you understand these changes, the faster you’ll be able to align your behaviours with the new definition of high performance.

#### What is your company strategy? 

* Organisations strategy focus on achieve one of two goals:
	* Win by being the most innovative company
	* Win by being the most efficient company
	* Each of the both strategies requires different capabilities and mindsets in order to succeed.
* Winning through innovation may require::
		* Greater risk taking
		* Creativity
		* Comfort with ambiguity
* Winning through efficiency may require:
	* More dispassionate thinking
	* process orientation
	* Six sigma capabilities.
* Science says that a pure strategy (winning by being most efficient or most innovative) will always outperform a blended strategy of trying to be kind of good at each 

#### What Are Your Companys Change Needs?

* An organisation may be going through a merger, economic shock, rapid growth, turnaround or similar event that demands leaders who can manage major change. 
* Your success in each scenario requires very different capabilities.
* If you combine strategy and the change concepts, you end up with a four-box grid called the “fix matrix” that you can us to assess how you fit with different company environments,

![](8%20Steps%20to%20high%20performance%20-%20Focus%20on%20what%20you%20can%20change%20(ignore%20the%20rest)/Screen%20Shot%202018-09-09%20at%2019.46.09.png)


### Understand Where You Naturally Fit

* Since you know that fit matters, you should develop in the right direction to maximise fit and performance. This starts by identifying where you naturally fit.
* How you fit is driven by your personality (fixed 50%), and the capabilities you’ve gained during your career, and the work environment you prefer. 
* these combined factors cause you to prefer a certain way of working and make you more capable ins one situations than in others.

#### First Determine your fit.

* Mark the box in the following which closely describes the work environment or challenges that most interest you. 
* With the Answers of the following:
	1. Count the numbers of marks in each column
	2. Divide each number by 2
	3. Subtract the result in column B from the result in Column A. Write down the number, which may be negative

![](8%20Steps%20to%20high%20performance%20-%20Focus%20on%20what%20you%20can%20change%20(ignore%20the%20rest)/Screen%20Shot%202018-09-09%20at%2019.49.58.png)

* Again, Mark the box in the following which closely describes the work environment or challenges that most interest you. 
* Again, With the Answers of the following:
	1. Count the numbers of marks in each column
	2. Divide each number by 2
	3. Subtract the result in column B from the result in Column A. Write down the number, which may be negative
![](8%20Steps%20to%20high%20performance%20-%20Focus%20on%20what%20you%20can%20change%20(ignore%20the%20rest)/Screen%20Shot%202018-09-09%20at%2019.50.48.png)


#### Map Yourself

![](8%20Steps%20to%20high%20performance%20-%20Focus%20on%20what%20you%20can%20change%20(ignore%20the%20rest)/Screen%20Shot%202018-09-09%20at%2019.52.40.png)


1. With the blank matrix above, Start in the centre of the grid
2. take your answers from the first quiz, starting in the centre of the grid, and if your number is positive, move that many steps to the right, if negative, that many steps to the left. Make a small mark
3. From the mark you made in number 2, take the results from quiz number two, if its positive, move that many steps up, if its negative, move that many steps down. Make a point.

* The point you’ve mapped yourself suggests the type of environment in which you naturally fit best. 

#### Determine your comapnys needs 

* This will require you to know your comapnys future strategy well enough to amp it on the same two dimensions - strange and change
* Future strategy is more important than current strategy because you need to know how you can best fit going forward.
* There are a few ways to best understand your company and its strategy:
	* You’re involved enough in your organisations strategy to be able to map it on the matrix
	* You explain the fit matrix to a few key leaders and ask them to amp where they see your company three to four years from now
	* If you work in a  public company, your company website likely has an investor relationships page that includes presentations or an executive summary of the company future strategy. Read them and use them to map your company.
* Once you’ve assessed your company strategy, draw an “F” on the fit matrix at the intersection fo your company future strategy and change choices.

#### Finally, assess your fit.

* How close is your natural fit from your company future needs?
* If you and your company are in the same box, you’re well positioned.
* if theres any greater distance between you and your company future position on the matrix, it may be more challenging for you to be a nigh performer.
* There are some ways to close the gaps:
![](8%20Steps%20to%20high%20performance%20-%20Focus%20on%20what%20you%20can%20change%20(ignore%20the%20rest)/Screen%20Shot%202018-09-09%20at%2020.04.06.png)

### Manage Your Fit to Maximise Your Performance

* Your company likely does not assess your fit, so you can improve yourself and your team by applying this simple methodology
* When you know your fit, try this approach in your next development conversation with your manager:

1. Share your insights about your company. Tell your manager about your assessment of the company direction and the implications for you
2. Share your insights about yourself. Tell your manager where you believe you fit and why
3. Share your plan. Share how you would like to grow and develop given what company needs from its leaders.
4. Ask or advice. Ask your manager for any guidance they can give you about the company changes or your won development

### What Can Get In the Way

* I work for one of many business units in my company. Should I fit with that business unit or with the company strategy -> You should try to fit with the unit where you work. 
* If I admit to my manger that I’m not a good fit, aren’t I risking my job? -> you should tell your manger that you want to make sure you’re a high performer by alway adapting to changes int he company strategy. Present your analysis and your plan for closing any gaps.
* How accurate do I have to be in mapping my fit or my comapnys fit? -> The fit matrix is a guide to help you think about how closely aligned you are or sent with the business strategy. The greater the distance, the more difficulty you have adjusting your behaviours and skills. If you’re more than half a grid apart from you and your company placements, ask yourself if you’ll be engaged in that environment.

### Remember and Apply

#### The Science Says:

* Companies change faster than people do, and they require different capabilities than their leaders as they change
* When you fit better with a company strategy and change needs, you will be more engaged and a higher perofrmer.
* We each fit best in different company scenarios due to our personality, career path, and personal preference; none of us is the best fit in every scenario 

#### You Should:

* Understand where you naturally fit in a company life cycle
* Understand where your company will be three to five years from today on the fit matrix
* Learn and demonstrate the capabilities and behaviours needed to perform well in that future state

#### Try Using:

* Fit matrix and fit assessment to understand your natural fit and how closely it fits with what your company needs.

## Step 6: Fake it 

### Why It matters

*  A high performer needs to understand and display the few most powerful behaviours needed at the moment.
* Since you have a preferred way of behaving, you’re faking it any time you consciously display a behaviour that doesn’t agree with your preferences. This is OK
* As your career evolves, your continued high performance will require you to show new behaviours. How fast your adapt to these behaviours will help differentiate you as a high performer.
* Your ability to, as the saying goes “fake it until you make it” is an essential way to practice the behaviours that will ensure your success going forward.
* Each new behaviour moves you closer to your theoretical maximum performance  

### What We Know

* Research suggests:
	* Theres only a little fixed 50% in faking it. How often you fake behaviours is slightly influenced by your core personality. 
	* Men a slightly more willing to fake behaviours than women.
	* We effectively disguise our true selves when we fake it. People are less accurate in identifying your true personality when your are a behaviour. 

### What to Do 

* Sometimes in your career you will need to behave outside your preferred style.
	* you may need to work harder to allow your team to deliver results rather than trying to do everything yourself. 
	* you may need to appear more powerful to secure resources or build relationships.
* Your behaviours will help differentiate your success in these scenarios, so its helpful to know which few behaviours matter most and how too are them if need be.
* There are three key scenarios where your fixed 50% and personal preferences may require you to fake a different set of  behaviours, including:
	* You need to emerge as a leader
	* You need to be a more effective leader
	* You need to demonstrate power.

### You Need to Emerge as a leader

* Leaders differentiate themselves by building relationships up, down and across the organisation.
* Effective leaders differentiate themselves by how well they communicate and mange their teams. 
* When you’re new to a role, new to a company, or just starting your career, “emergence” behaviours are critical to getting noticed as a high performer.
* These behaviours allow your to emerge as a leader by calling attention to you so that others become more personally and professionally familiar with you. 
* You cannot be an effective leader until you emerge as one. 
* There and three key behaviours that you should fake to emerge and get noticed as a leader

#### Promote your ideas

* At the heart of emerging as a leader is the requirement that you want your accomplishments to be noticed.
* You can do this easily by having a point of view on important topics, as base of facts to justify your opinions, and the courage to speak up and present your points of view. 
* Speaking up and appearing self-confident while doing it is the most consistent predictor of successful emerging. 
* You need some ego to seek recognition of your ideas; theres a tipping point between emergence and arrogance.
* You should speak up in a meeting when you have a good idea, not let others peak over you, and express that idea with the same confidence with which you’re state your own name. 

#### Make Friends (Or At Least Contacts)

* The right people need to see you at the right time.
* The social component of this means that you’re visible at company events, have lunch and coffee with your peers and important superior, and chat with teammates during the day.
* To get noticed you also need to do well at managing up. You need to make your manager like you by seeking his or her input where possible, doing high-quality work, and asking for the highest profile assignments.

#### Show Ambition

* You must demonstrate that you want to succeed and contribute more to your organisation to be a high performer.
* Directly tell your manager that you want to contribute more and that you will deliver, behave and sacrifice to do so.
* You need to demonstrate a competitive edge - a passionate o win as an individual or to drive your team to bigger results..
* The obvious path is to deliver very high-quality work, hold your team to incredibly high-performance standards, and call out others who aren’t performing to a high enough standard.

### You need to be a more effective leader

* Emerging leader focuses on him or herself. 
* A effective leader subsumes his ego and shifts focus to getting bigger results through and with others.
* Effective leaders spend more time on the day-to-day management of the business while building the quality and depth of their team.
* The three tactics to get you there faster are as follows:

#### Tell a Crisp, clear story about your vision.

* At least once a quarter, you should develop and communicate to your team a vision with these three points:
	* Crisply describe the future state. using a from/to statement. 
	* Tell why the future is exciting and necessary. State why that vision describes a better place for the business than where you are today 
	* Sell the benefits. Your team members are interested in the company future, but they care about their own future. Describe how their life will be better in the vision that you describe. 

#### Assess and upgrade your talent

* Effective leaders understand that better-quality talent delivers better business results, and they invest the time to build high-quality teams. 
* A technique the author suggests is buy_sell_hold. 
	* You categorise your teams like you would an investment portfolio. Would you:
		* Buy (invest more)
		* Sell (Invest less or get rid of)
		* Hold (keep the same)

#### Provide Brutally Honest Coaching

* As human beings, we’re hard-wired to get along with others, so being brutally honest with someone typically feels uncomfortable. 
* Doing it well is also a hallmark of leaders who create high-performing teams.
* You want to tell each of your team members on unique thing that you know will improve their performance. 
* As an exercise, list one thing next to each team members name, and get them to work on that over a period of time. 
* As you shift to effective leader behaviours, you may worry you won’t be fairly recognised if your team delivers -> This is actually the opposite, they will make you seem more impressive 

### You Need to Demonstrate Power

* Power is the ability to change others well-being, finances, and attitudes.
* Sometimes you need to exert power to succeed in your organisation, but power isn’t available to you at a moments notice. you must cultivate it over time.
* Politics is the game being played, and you’re a player in that game.
* There are three steps that will get you more power, more quickly:

#### Be Consistently Visible

* Show up, then show up again and again.
* The more familiar you are to someone, the more positively they think about you
* People feel that familiar things are less likely to surprise them, which appeals to their risk-averse nature. The more often someone sees you, hears you, reads about you and interacts with you, the more you’re building your potential power to influence them.

#### Manage Up

* As mentioned before

#### Make Your Boss Very Happy

* Your boss is int he best position to give you power, and you want to perform strongly in the areas that he or she cares most about. 


### Remember and Apply

#### The Science Says

* Different types of behaviours will benefit us in different situations
* We are all capable of changing our behaviours; dramatic changes will require more effort but are still 100% possible
* The shift from behaving like an emerging leader to behaving like an effective leader is especially important to make at the right time

#### You should

* Understand the key behaviours that will most benefit your performance in different scenarios Forget the genuine you and focus on being the most effective you
* Recognise that faking it is just part of the behaviour change process; its the first round of practice 
* Assess your career stage, development needs, and environment to see what type of faking will have the largest benefits to you

#### Try using:

* Feedforward process to get Insights to which behaviour changes are most important.

## Step 7: Commit Your Body

### Sleep Quality

* Theres only a small relationship between sleep quality and sleep quantity, which means that a great nights sleep depends less on the number o hours than you might think

#### Quality Impacts Performance More Than Quantity

* Low quality sleep reduces your performance and your perceived job satisfaction and increases how much you think about quitting your job,

#### Bad Mood? Its sleep quality, not quantity

* Sleep quality affects your mood about four times as much as sleep quantity.

### Sleep quantity 


* Six hours is the minimum for the amount of sleep we naturally require

#### Sleep loss hurts your basic functions, not your executive ones

* It hurts your basic skill more than your advanced ones. 


#### Your not fine with Five hours every night

* Only about 5% of people can fully function on less than 6 hours of sleep per night.

### What to do

* Need to answer 3 questions to determine the right about of sleep and how best compensate when they don’t get it:
	
#### How Do I Get The Right Quality and Quantity of Sleep

* 6-7 hours of sleep is a reasonable starting point.
* This may add a little bit of sleep debt during the week, but you can replenish that debt on the weekend.
* Try the following recommendations into your sleep routine:
	* Go to sleep and wake up at consistent times every day.
	* No caffeine within six hours of bed time.
	* No alcohol within three hours of bedtime
	* Have a higher-carb meal close to bedtime.

#### When my sleep quality is low ( or I know it will be low), how do I ensure strong performance the next day?

* Self awareness -> Recognize that you’re likely to be in a worse mood, which will cause negative thoughts. 
* Low blood sugar may make you moody, so keep it stable throughout the day. 
* Do intense morning exercise

#### When my sleep quality is low, how do I ensure a strong delivery the next day?

* Naps -> 10 minute naps are optimal.
* Caffeine -> Of all possible foods, only caffeine directly affects performance with clear, broad-based benefits like faster reaction time, decreased fatigue, mood improvement, better working memory and more.

### Exercise and Performance

* While sleep gives you direct and meaningful performance benefits, exercise turns out to have much smaller and mainly long-term effects.
* The science says:
	* Exercise helps most with executive functions -> Executive functions help you plan, manage yourself and pursue goals. 
	* You won’t remember more with exercise
	* Exercise creates a virtuous circle -> People who are more physically fit get more performance benefits from exercise, but those with moderate fitness levels don’t benefit at all. Those with poor fitness levels actually see lower executive functioning when they exercise
* How to enhance your performance with exercise:
	* Intense exercise -> Aerobic and weights. At least 20 minutes per bine
	* Combine exercise and caffeine -> Exercise doesn’t have any effect on your basic brain functions, so you’ll get the best performance results if you incorporate exercise and caffeine to juice your basic and advanced capabilities.

### Diet

* Healthy diets provide many long-term benefits, but no science suggests that any specific set of foods or diet routine leads directly to higher performance at work.

### Remember and Apply

#### The Science Says:

* Sleep quality matters more than sleep quantity; six to seven hours is the sleep sweet spot
* Lower-order skills fail first when you don’t get enough sleep
* Naps and caffeine are scientifically proven to partially make up for low sleep quality and quanitity

#### You Should

* Let others at work know when you’ve had a bad nights sleep, not as an excuse for your behaviours, but so they can remind you to behave well
* Use one ten-minute nap where possible and caffeine to temporarily make up for low sleep quality or quantity
* Do an intense morning workout to slightly boost your performance during the day and party make up for low sleep quality

- - - -

## Step 8: Avoid Distractions

### What (Not) To Do

* You should carefully evaluate any concept that’s marketed as a quick and easy way to improve performance. (Use the “research, science or conclusive science” screen”

### (Please don’t) Focus on Your Strengths

* Those who suggest a strengths focus offer no scientific proof that people perform at a higher level or develop more effectively if they do this. 
* On the other hand, research hows:
	* The behaviours we need to succeed as we move up in an organization change, so today’s strengths may be irrelevant tomorrow
	* We have fewer strengths than we think we do (if we define a strength as being meaningfully better at something than others)
	* Our weaknesses (Aka detailers in earlier chapters) will slow or stop your career progress
* Focusing on your strengths will help you get better at the exact same thing you are good at today, but nothing else

#### What to do instead

* Your strengths are your strengths because of your personality, career path, and interests - they’ll never stop being your strengths
* Keep listening to others about the skills and behaviours that you should improve to be more successful. -> They’ll be more than happy to find a few non strengths for you to focus on.

### Emotional Intelligence Doesn’t Predict Leadership Success. 

* Whats often sold as emotional intelligence (EI) is almost entirely from the fixed 50% factor of personality and does not predict job performance any better than personality does.

#### What To Do Instead 

* Its helpful to understand how people see you manage your own and others emotional and correct any harmful behaviours.


### Ten Thousand Hours of Practice Is Exhausting and Irrelevant.

* Science says thats simply not true. Research shows that hours of practice only accounts for 1/3 of someones performance.
* Other science shows that Olympic athletes and chess masters far outperformed their peers even as children, before they could accumulate many hours of practice
* That means practice helps, but its not the magical solution  to performance that some claim it to be

#### What to do instead

* Recognise that natural talent plus lots of practice will produce great results
* No natural talent plus lots of practice will produce a reasonable weekend backhand or jump shot

### You Wont Develop Grit by Reading a Book

* A ted talk claims grit is the key success
* However, grit is almost entirely the well-known personality factor of conscientiousness and therefore solidly in the fixed 50%

#### What To Do Instead

* Use goal setting tactics in step one. 

### Behave for Results, Not Necessarily “Authentically”

* Authentic leadership is built on shaky foundations of “emotional intelligence”, rather than leadership behaviours.

#### What to do instead

* Do as mentioned in step 2 -> Behave to perform.
* And step 6 -> Fake it

### A Growth Mindset is Great - for Children

* Growth mindset -> Mental attitude believing that we can always increase our intelligence, while those with a fixed mindset believe that we are who we are. 
* The primary research from this was based on children in a classroom environment, not on adults with fully formed brains.
* No matter how hard adults try to meaningfully increase their IQ at age thirty, they can’t do it.
* Theres also a fixed 50% personality component to whether you naturally have a growth mindset or not. 

#### What to do instead

* Follow the advice throughout the 8 steps.
* You’re not going to become more intelligent because you do this, but you will likely achieve a lot more than if you just ry to change your mindset

### Power Posing Is Perhaps the Silliest Management Fad Ever

* According to one of the articles coauthors, they have never been anklet replicate the original research. 

#### What to do instead

* Stand any way you want to stand - it doesn’t matter
