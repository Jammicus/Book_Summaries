### Peter Attias Definition of Success

> “Success is: Do your kids remember you for being the best dad? Not the dad who gave them everything,
>but will they be able to tell you anything one day?
> Will they able to call you out of the blue, any day, no matter what?

### Coach Sommer

> If the commitment is to a long-term goal, and not to a series of smaller intermediate goals, then only one “decision needs to be made and adhered to. Clear, simple, straightforward. Much easier to maintain than having to make small decision after small decision to stay the course when dealing with each step along the way. This provides far too many opportunities to inadvertently drift from your chosen goal. The single decision is one of the most powerful tools in the toolbox.

--------------------------------------------------------------
## Wealthy

> It may be lucky, but it's not an accident.

-------------------------------

### Chris Sacca (Investor)

> What did you assign to yourself, and what did are you doing to please someone else? Your inbox is a to-do list to which anyone in the world can add an action item.

* Do what you want to do, not what others want you to do.
* Go to as many higher-level meetings as possible.
	* Figure out how to be helpful.
	* If others are wondering why you are there, start taking notes.
	* Read all the other notes you can find on the company, and gain a general knowledge that your very limited job function may not offer you.
* Being a successful investor is not just about knowing where to invest. Its making sure founders know who you are. Have a way that others can recognize you (Chris uses silly cowboy shirts).
* When the going gets tough, remind yourself this is temporary, tomorrow is a new day.
* Ask dumb questions, experience will never eliminate all the dumb questions.
* Empathy is superb for life and business.
* Good stories always beat good spreadsheets
	* People get behind leaders who stir our feelings.

### Marc Andreessen (One of the internets founding fathers)

> The number-one theme that companies have when they really struggle is they are not charging enough for their product .

> The keys to success is to be so good that they can't ignore you, and that smart people should make things.

* Look at what others do on their weekend, or in the evening. That will give you a great understanding of a person.
* When someone brings a new idea to the table, have someone completely destroy the idea. If others still agree with the original idea, move forward.
* Dwelling in the past is a waste of time. Move forward.
* Get inside the heads of the people ho made things in the past and what they were actually like, and realize that they're not that different from you.
* Bet for change. Mistakes happen when you don't expect change to happen.  Be looking forward at the future.
* Your goal should be to succeed over the long run, not fail fast. These are completely different things.
* To do original work: It's not necessary to know some-thing nobody else knows. It is necessary to believe some-thing few other people believe
* For every metric, there should be another 'paired' metric that addresses adverse consequences of the first metric.
* Every billionaire suffers from the same problem. Nobody around them ever says, "Hey, that stupid idea you just had is really stupid"

###  Arnold Schwarzenegger (Actor, Body builder, Govenerner...)

> I was not there to compete. I was there to win

* Have a very clear vision of where you want to go, then the rest is much easier.
* Asking questions that point to others weaknesses throw them off for a very long time (Eg, did you hurt your knee? Looks like you can squat as much.)
* In negotiation, he who cares the least wins.
* Own or create your own unique niche.
* Can I trade a short-term, incremental gain for a potential longer-term, game changing upside? Is there a element here that might be far more valuable in 5 to 10 years? Might there be rights or options I can explicitly "carve out" and keep?

----------------------------------
### Derek Sivers (Exceptional Programmer)

> If more information was the answer, then we'd all be billionaires with perfect abs
> How to thrive in an unknowable future? Choose the plan with the most options. The best plan is the one that lets you change your plans

* When looking for your motive, ask why to your answers 3 times. This will deleve deeper.
* When starting out, say yes to many things.
* The standard pace of things is for chumps, go faster than them
* Dont' be a donkey. You can do everything you want, but you need foresight and patience
* When you have some success, start saying no to more and more things
* If you are busy, it implies you are out of control. Lack of time shows lack of priorities.
* Have unpopular opinions.
* Treat life as a series of experiments. DO little tests living the life you think you want, but leave yourself an exit plan. Be open to the fact that you might not like it after actually trying it.

-----------------
### Productivity tricks for the neurotic, manic-depress and crazy

>What you do is more important than how you do everything else, and doing something well does not make it important

* Reality check yourself. What are your fears
* Successful people also go through trials and tribulations.
* Successful people are just like you, they are not different.

8 Steps to maximize efficiency

1. Wake up 1 hour before you have to be at a computer screen
2. Make a coffee and sit down with a pen and paper
3. Write down 3-5 things that you are anxious or uncomfortable.
4. For each item, ask yourself  : What, if done, will make all of the rest easier or irrelevant.
5. Look only at the items you've answered yes to for at least one of these questions
6. Block of 2-3 hours to focus on one of them for today. Let the rest of the urgent but less important slide. It will still be there tomorrow
7. TO BE CLEAR: Block out at 2 to 3 HOURS to focus on ONE of them for today. This is ONE BLOCK OF TIME. Cobbling together 10 minutes here and there to add up to 120 minutes does not work. No phone calls or social media allowed.
8. If you get distracted or start procrastinating, don’t freak out and downward-spiral; just gently come back to your ONE to-do.

	* Clever
	* Cute
	* Bizarre
	* Mean
	* Recognizable
* Systems are a series of projects and habits that, even if they result in failures in the eyes of the outside world, give you transferable skills or relationships
	* "What persistent skills or relationships can I achieve?" VS  "What short-term goal can I achieve?"
* Pick a goal and write it down 15 times a day in some specific sentence form, then go about being that.
	* Eg "I James Walter will be an excellent developer"
* Check your facts regularly

**How to want to be extraordinary**
There are two different options for this:

1. Be the best at one specific things.
2. Become very good (top 25%) at two or more things.

You should follow the second strategy.
You make yourself `rare`  by combining two or more "Pretty goods" until no-one else has your mix. Where at least one of your skills involves communication, either written or verbal, and the second being your passion.
