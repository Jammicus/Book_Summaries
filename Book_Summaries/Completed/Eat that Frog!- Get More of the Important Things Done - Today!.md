# Eat that Frog!: Get More of the Important Things Done - Today!

---

## 1. Set The Table

* You must decide what you want to achieve in each area of your life.
* Clarity is perhaps the most important concept in personal productivity
* Main reason people get more work done fast is because they are clear about their goals and objectives and they don't deviate from them
* Major reason for procrastination and lack of motivation is vagueness, confusion and fuzzy-mindedness about what you are trying to do and in what order and for what reason.

Steps to follow:

1. Decided exactly what you want. Sit down with managers and ask what to do to get where you want to go
2. Write it down. When you do this you crystalize it and give it tangible form
3. Set a deadline on your goal; set sub-deadlines if necessary
4. Make a list of everything that you can think of that you are going to have to do to achieve your goal
5. Organize the list into a plan
6. Take action on your plan immediately
7. Resolve to do something every single day that moves you toward your major goal (build this into your daily schedule)

## 2. Plan Everyday in Advance

* Your ability to make good plans before you act is a measure of your overall competence
* Remember **"Proper prior planning prevents poor performance"**
* Always work from a list.
* Write things on your list as soon as they come up.
* Ideally make your list the night before the work day ahead (or just before you leave the office in the evening)
* You need different lists for different purposes
	* The master list : This has everything you can think of that you want to do sometime in the future
	* The monthly list : You make this at the end of the month or the month ahead. This may contain items transferred from your master list
	* Weekly list : Where you plan your entire week in advance. This is a list that is under construction as you go through the current week
	* You should transfer items from your monthly and weekly lists into your daily lists
* Remember to rank each item on these lists with priority, and what needs to be done to do a specific item

## 3. Apply the 80/20 Rule to Everything

* 20% of your activities will account for 80% of your results.
* This means out of a list of 10 items, 2 of them will turn out to be worth give or 10 times for than the other eight items put together
* Focus on activities, not accomplishments
* People who seem busy all day long but seem to accomplish very little are focusing on low value tasks but procrastinating on the one or two activities that would make the difference
* The most valuable tasks you can do each day are often the hardest and most complex, but the payoff and rewards for completing these tasks efficiently can be tremendous
* You must refuse to work on the bottom 80% when you have some of the 20% left to be done
* Before working, ask "**Is this task in the 20%?** if so, do it.
* Resist the temptation to clear up small things first
* Thinking about starting and finishing an important task will motivate you to do it
* Everyday start the day with the most important task that needs doing. End your day with "Quick wins"

Steps to do this:

1. make a list of the key goals, activities, projects and responsibilities in your life
2. Resolve to work on the areas that will make the most difference

## 4. Consider the Consequences

* The mark of the superior thinker is his or her ability to accurately predict the consequences of doing or not doing something.
* Your attitude toward time has an enormous impact on your behavior and your choices.
* Always look at the long term, this will improve short term decision making
* Future intent influences and often determines present actions
* **Successful people are those who are willing to delay gratification and make sacrifices in the short term so that they can enjoy far greater rewards in the long term**
* If a task or activity has large potential positive consequences, make it a top priority and get started on it immediately
* There will never be enough time to do everything you want to do, but there will always be time to do the most important things

Questions to ask:

1. What are my highest-value activities?
2. What can I and only I do that if done well will make a real difference?
3. What is the most valuable use of my time right now?

## 5. Practice Creative Procrastination

* You cant avoid procrastination
* You should procrastinate on the small tasks
* You can get your time and your life under control only to the degree to which you discontinue lower-value activities
* One of the most powerful of all words in time management is to say no
* Say no to anything that is not a high value use of your time and your life
* Continually review your life and work to find time-consuming tasks and activities that you can abandon. (Eg, watching tv, playing games) Do stuff that enhances your quality of life

## 6. Use the ABCDE Method Continually

* Review your work list and categorize tasks ABCDE based on importance
* Start on the As immediately, then move down the chair

## 7. Focus on Key Result Areas

* Ask yourself "Why am i on the payroll?"
* This is one of the most important questions you can ask and answer, over and over again, throughout your career
* You've been hired to get specific results
* Your job can be broken down into about five to seven key result areas
* Find out these key areas and grade yourself on your performance
* Improve the areas where you are not performing well
* Your weakest key result area sets the height at which you can use all your other skills and abilities
* Ask yourself **What one skill, if I developed and did it in an excellent fashion, would have the greatest positive impact on my career?**
* Ask this question to your boss, and co workers
* Remember all business skills are learnable

## 8. Apply the Law of Three

* Three core tasks that you perform contain most of the value that you contribute to your business or organization
* Your ability to actively identify these three key tasks and then to focus on them most of the time is essential for you to perform at your best
* Ask yourself out of the three most importance tasks you can do, what would contribute the greatest value to your career. Repeat this 3 times
* identify the 3 most important life goals you have and focus on them

## 9. Prepare Thoroughly Before you Begin

* Always aim to have everything you need at hand before you begin
* Your work area should be somewhere you enjoy spending time.
* The cleaner and neater your work area before you begin, the easier it will be for you to get started and keep going
* When doing your goals, get 80% of it right, then correct the 20% that is wrong later

## 10. Take it one oil barrel at a time

* Ask yourself "What is it in me that is holding me back?"
* Take action on things that are holding you back immediately
