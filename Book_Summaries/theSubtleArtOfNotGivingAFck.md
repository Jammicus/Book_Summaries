## Don't Try

* Self improvement and success often occur together. This does not mean that they're the same thing
* Culture today has unrealistic expections for happiness,health ect
* Confident people do not feel the need to prove that they are confident
* The desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience, and the acceptance of ones negative experience is itself a positive experience
* When you care less less about something, you do better at it (The backward law)
* If pursuing the postitive is a negative, then pursuing the negative generates the positive
* Being open with your insecrurities makes you more confident and charismatic around others.
* Everything worthwhile in life is won through surmounting the associated negative experience. trying to avoid the negative will fail

## THe Subtle Art of Not Giving A Fuck

* Not giving a fuck does not mean being indifferent, it means being confortable with being different
	* Theres nothing admirable or confident about indifference. People who are indifferent are lame and scared.
	* You must give a fuck about something
	* Its not about being indifferent, its about **not caring about the adversity in the way of your goals**
	* You can't be an important and life-changing presence for some people without also being a joke and an embarrassment to others.
* To not give a fuck about adversity, you must first give a fuck about something mroe important than adversity
	* Dont give fucks for things that are not worth giving a fuck over
	* If you are giving fucks about irrelevent stuff, you do not have enough going on in your life
	* When a person has no problems, the mind automatically finds a way to invent some. 
* Whether you realize it or not, you are always choosing what to give a fuck about	* Give your fucks for only the most truly fuck worth parts of your life.

## Happiness is a Problem

* Life itself is a form of suffering. The rich suffer because of their riches, the poor for their lack of riches, so on
* Not all suffering is equal
* Happiness is not a solvable equation
* Having healthy does of pain and suffering in your life is vital

## Happiness Comes from Solving Problems

* Solving problems creates new problems
* Problems will never stop, they just get exchanged and or upgrated
* Avoiding problems will not generate happiness, it will generate misery
* Happiness is a form of action towards a problem, not something that is done passively
* Happiness is a constant work-in-progress, because solvign problems is a constant work-in-progress
* The solution t todays problems will lay the foundation for tomorrows problems.
* **True happiness occurs only when you find the problems you enjoy having and enjoying solving**
* Two aspects that stop you from solving your problems:
	* Denial
	* Victim mentality

## Emotions Are Overrated

* Emotions evolved to help us live and reproduce a little bit better.
* They're feedback mechanisms telling us that something is eitgher likely right or likely wrong for us - nothing more, nothing less
* THey are not the enitre equation of your life. 
* Just because something feels good it does not mean it is good. 
* To deny ones negative emotions is to deny many of the feedback mechanisms that help a person solve problems. 

## Choose Your Struggle

* Ask your self *What pain do you want in your life?*
	* Pain is inevitable, you should decide what pain you are willing to have
	* Happiness requires the struggle you get from problems
* The joy itself is the journey to the end

## You are not special

* Entitled people exude a delusional degree of self-confidence. This confidence can be alluring to others, but only for a little while.
* Entitlement makes people need to feel good all the timeThe true measurement of self is not how a person feels about her positive experiences, but rather, **how she feels about the negative experiences.**
* A person who actually has a high self-worth is able to look at the negative parts of his character, and then acts to improve on that part. 

## The Tyranny of Exceptionalism

* MOst of us are pretty average at most things we do
* You may be exceptional at something, but you will be below average at others.
* To become great something **You must dedicate a shit load of time and energy**
* Our lifes are full of extreams, the great of the great or the worst of the worst. There is a great lack of middle ground


## The Value of Suffering

* You should ask yourself ***Why am I suffering - for what purpose?***

## The Self-Awareness Onion

* Self-awareness is like an onion. It has multiple layers, and the more you peel them back, the more likely you will cry.
* The first layer is understanding ones emotions. 
	* We all have emotional blind spots. 
	* Takes years of spotting these emotions and express the affected emotions appropriately. 
* The second layer is self awareness. Why we feel certain emotions
	* This is incredibly hard, and will take you years to answer the whys
	* This helps you understand the root cause of the emotions that overwhelm us. 
	* When you understand the root cause, then you can ideally do something about it
* The third layer is your personal values
	* How am I choosing to measure myself?
	* By what standard am i judging myself and everyone around me?
	* This takes constant questioning and effort
	* Values underlie everything we are and do
	* Most people struggle greatly with this level
	
## Shitty Values

* The following are crap values that create really poor problems for people - the type of problems that can hardly be solved.
	* Pleasure
		* This is not the cause of happiness, getting everything else right will give you pleasure
	* Material Success
		* Many eople believe that how much they make determines their self worth.
		* You should be measuring yourself by your behaviour, not your status
	* always being right
	* Staying positive
		* Its healthy to feel shitty from time to time.
		* The trick is to express them in a socially acceptable and healthy manner and express them in a way that aligns them with your values


## Defining Good and bad Values

* Good values are:
	* Reality based
	* Socially constructive
	* Immediate and controllable
* Bad values are:
	* Superstitious
	* Socially destructive
	* not immediate or controllable
* Good and healthy values are achieved internally
* Bad values are reliant on external events
* **Self improvement is about prioritizing better values, choosing better things to give a fuck about**

## You Are Always Choosing

* You may not have control of what happens to us. **But we always control how we interpret what happens to us, as well as how we respond**
* You are responsible for the experience. Choosing not to respond to certain events is still a responces.

## The Responsibility/Fault Fallacy

* Responsibility and fault often appear together in our culture, but they are not the same thing
* There are problems that we arent at fault for, yet we are still responsible for them
* Fault is past tense, responsibility is present tense
* Theres a key difference between blaming someone else for your situation and that person actually being responsible for ylur situation
* **No one is responsible for your situation apart from you**

## Responding to Tragedy

* The intensity of the event doesn't change the underlying truth.

## Architects of Our own beliefs
* The human mind is incredible at coming up and believing a bunch of bull-shit that is not real
* The brain is imperfect, it often mistakes things we see and hear.
* We also create meanings our self. These meanings may or not be true.
* Most of our beliefs are wrong. 
* The human mind is a jumble of inaccuracy.

## Becareful What You Believe

* Your minds biggest priority when processing experiences is to interpret them in such a way that they will cohere with all of our previous experiences, feelings, and beliefs.
* Often, it is possible that you mind will "fill in the gaps" with incorrect information

## The Dangers of pure Certainty

* The more that you try to seek certainty over a situaton, the more you will feel uncertain and insecure.
* Uncertainty removes our judgements of others.
* Uncertainty however, is the root of all progress and all growth
* You must be open to being wrong to grow, have a sense of peace that you are uncertain about certain things.


## How to Be a Little Certain of Yourself

* What if I am wrong?
	* That is completely fine.
	* We are the worlds worst observers of ourselves.
	* You need to be able to ask yourself what is the worst that could happen
	* For change to happen, you **MUST** be wrong about something
* What would it mean if I were wrong?
	* Being able to look at and evaluate different values without necessarily adopting them is the most critical skill in changing ones life.
	* Again, there is nothing wrong with being wrong
* Would being wrong create a better or a worse problem than my current problem, for both myself and others?
	* If it feels like its you versus the world, changes are it's really just you versus yourself.

## Failure Is the Way Forward

* Failure will eventually lead to success

## The Failure/Success Paradox

* Improvement at anything is based on thousands of tiny failures, and the magnitude of your success is based on how many times you've failed at something
* If someone is better than you at something, its likely because she has failed at it more than you have
* Fear of failure is from choosing shitty values

## Pain Is Part of the Process

* Our most radical changes often happen at the tail end of our worst momeent.
* Only when we feel intense pain we will be willing to look at our values and question why they seem to be failing us.
* Learn to sustain pain. You can withstand and get over the pain.

## The 'Do Something" Principle

* **Don't just sit there. Do something. The answers will follow**
* Action is not just the effect of motiviation, its also the cause of it
* The key mindset should be **Take action -> be inspired by your aciton -> Motivation occurs from this -> Repeat**
* Doing this will accustomize yourself so that failure feels unimportant

## Learning To Say No

* Sometimes, you will have to say no to others.
* There is nothing wrong with this, you must do this for your own growth

## Boundaries

* The difference between a healthy and unhealthy relation ship is:
 * How well each person in the relationship accepts responsibility
 * The willingness of each person to both reject and be rejected by their partner
* Boundaries are the delineation between two peoples responsiblities for their own problems. 
* Each person should take repsonsibility for their problems, and not make their partner suffer for this.
* you should not take responsiblity for others emotions and feelings that cause you to alter your own way of life.
* In unhealthy relationships, theirs the victim and the saver, the perosn who starts the fire because it makes them feel important, and the person who puts out the fire because it makes them feel important.
* These relationships actually result in needs not being met.
* Take responsibility for your own prolems and dont hold your partner responsible for them

## How to Build Trust

* Honesty is more important than feeling good all the time
* Without conflict, there can be no trust
* Conflict exists to show us who is there for us unconditionally, and who is just there for the benefits.
* No one trusts a yes man
* You dont feel loved until you trust that the love being expressed towrd you comes without any pecial conditions or baggage attached to it.
* Building trust takes time, a  lot more time than is needed to break trust
* Trust is like a china plate. If you break it once, with some care and attention you can put it back together but when it is broken to many times, it cannot be fixed.

## Freedom Through Commitment

* The more oftens you are given, the less likely you will trust the decision you make.
* Reject what does not truly matter to you
* Commitment allows you to focus intently on a few highly important goals and achieve a greater degree of succes than you otherwise could.
* Depth, rather than bredth, is where the gold is buried.
* This true for relationships, careers and building a great lifestyle
