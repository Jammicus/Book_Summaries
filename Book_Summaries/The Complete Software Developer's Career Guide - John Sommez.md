## The Most Important Technical Skills

* When learning a language, learn the ins and outs of it before moving onto another language.
* You should strive to learn how to write good, clean code from the beginning
* Understand the fundamental principles of Object Oriented Design
* Try to always manage complexity
* Important to be able to write your own algorithms to problems, and analyze where your algorithms will have issues
* You should be familiar with the following data structures:
    * Arrays or Vectors
    * Linked Lists
    * Stacks
    * Queues
    * Trees
    * Hashes
    * Sets
* Make sure you know the complexities, how they work, how they store items in memory, and where best to apply these data structures
* Try to understand commonly used frameworks in your language (Eg, node.js)
* Understand the basic databases:
	* Relational
	* Document based
* For the above databases, learn:
	* How they work
	* How to perform basic queries to get data
	* How to insert, update and delete data
	* How to join databases together

## How To Develop Technical Skills

* When learning skills, think in terms of it being a journey rather than a destination

### Learning How to Learn Quickly

Steps:

1. Have a good idea of what you are learning and what scope of it is (Understand the big picture, then break it down)
2. Set a goal - What do you want to learn and why, and what metric will you use to know that you've learned it
3. Gather some resources: A book which you will cover to cover and one of the following: blog entries, podcasts, magazines, so on.
4. Create a learning schedule
5. Dive in, you must learn by doing - Try things out and understand the ins and outs of it
6. When you feel you know it, take what you have learnt and teach it someone

### Learn By Doing

* Until you have actually used it yourself, or solved problems with it, you will only have a surface level of understanding
* you must take action, rather than passively hoping you will understand
* its a good idea to do a mini project on the subject, to test your knowledge on that project.
* **THIS IS VITAL. YOU MUST PRACTICE AND DO IT OR YOU WILL NOT LEARN ANYTHING**


### 20% Principle

* Find the most important 20% of what you want to learn.
* Learn this inside and out by doing activities with this.


### Reading What Experts Say

* Read blogs and posts on what the experts are talking about.
* They will know the key areas of the subject

## What Programming Language should I learn?

* Learning your first language will be hardest.
* After that it becomes considerably easier to learn one
* Most important factor on choice of language is **what language is used in your job of choice**
* These are generally one of the following:
	* C#
	* Java
	* Python
	* Ruby
	* Javascript
	* C++
	* PHP
* If you are planning on doing freelance programming, you could probably specalize in a more eccentric and less widely used language
* Also pay attention of what is planned for the future of a language, learning Objective C is not a good idea when most people at moving over to swift!

## Learning your First Programming Language

* When learning a language, these are the basic constructs of what you should learn:
	* Ability to write output to the screen
	* Basic math capability
	* Storage of information as variables
	* Organization of code into functions, methods or modules
	* Invoke a function or method
	* Performance of boolean logic evaluations
	* Branch conditional statements (If/else)
	* Looping statements
* Take care to understand what is built into the language, and what is part of a library (Eg, random in java is part of a library)
* **Programming today is more about knowing how to use libraries and frameworks than being ab absolute expert in the language**
* Try look at existing code for that language, and understand each line
* Built lots of little things with the language

### Project Ideas

* Create a program that solves a mathematical problem by getting inputs from a user
* Simple texted based adventure game - where the user input determines what happens
* Read input from a text file and write output to a different text file
* Create a chat bot

### Mastering the language

* This is only done by practice
* You should be doing katas daily
* You WILL Suck at first, thats okay
* Soon you will notice patterns
* Once you have solved a kata, look at how others have solved it!


**Self-Education is one of the most valuable skills you can learn**



## What you need to know about software development

* you should have an overview of most of the programming languages, know what they are designed for what they are good and bad at

## Devops: A New Role

* A multidisciplinary process of getting code from development to production and taking care of the code when its there
* taking full ownership at every step along the way
* You need to understand the process and tools that are used to move code from development to production, and ideally how to use these tools.
* Understand how an application gets packed up and ready for distribution or deployment
* Understand the deployment process and how to automate moving code from a build server to a staging server or production server, and how configuration is managed
* You should know something about monitoring an existing application to check for performance problems and other issues

## Testing and QA Basics

* Have a good understanding of testing will help benefit your career immensely

### Basic Idea About Testing

* At its core, its about reducing risk
* You can never find all the bugs or defects in a piece of software, and you can never test every possible input into the software,
* **The focus and main idea behind software testing is to reduce the risk that the customer is greatly impacted in a negative manner**
	* Done by identifying which areas have the most risk and creating tests for that area

### Common Ways of Testing:

#### Black Box Testing

* Only concerned with the inputs and outputs
* Dont care about how it derives the output or the code itself


#### White Box Testing

* When you understand some of the internals of the system, and perhaps have access to the actual source code

#### Acceptance Testing

* Where you have some tests which test the actual requirements of expectations of the customer, and other tests that run against the system as a whole

#### Automated Testing

* Any testing in which the execution of the test and the verification of the results is automated

#### Regression Testing

* Testing done to verify that the system still works the way it did before

#### Functional Testing

Testing activities where what is being tested is the actual functionality of the system

#### Exploratory Testing

* "Lazy-ass testing"
* You have some guidelines and a basic plan of which application areas you are going to test and ways you are going to test them
* Then you go about without actual test cases and explore the application, looking for things that might be wrong or behavior that is unexpected

#### Other Forms of Testing

* Load testing - how a application performs under a heavy load
* Performance testing - Performance of the application based on certain scenarios
* Recovery Testing - Recovery from error conditions or hardware issues
* Stress testing
* Usability testing


## Continuous Integration

* its taking that slow, painful tedious and error-prone process of building the software, running tests against it, getting it packaged up to be deployed, and making it automatic
* Increasing the frequency in which code that individual developers are working on is merged together

## Jobs and Job Titles

### SDET (Software Development Engineer in Test)

* Software development role where you aren't writing production code, but instead are writing code to test code or working on tools

### Developer

* Traditional role

### Team Lead or Tech Leader

* Where you are leading a team, or doing some kind of management as well as development.

### Architect

* Designing the entire system
* Attending meetings to decide on technologies and architecture


## Working as A developer

* Make sure you are a bit more outgoing and friendly
* Use their first names when you greet them
* Be willing to help your fellow employees
* Gain a reputation for being a "go to" person on your team
* Avoid work place drama
* **You are in control of what you allow into your life and what you choose to invest your emotional and physical energy in**
* There will be conflict, it is not personal, its about finding the best solution
* Don't talk about politics or religion
* Only worry about you, not your co workers
* Shut up and do the best you can
* Try to get shit done without having to be asked
* **Manage yourself**
* **Create a weekly report each week detailing what you have worked on during the week**
* Take responsibility for the other members of your team and the team as a whole
* Be the person your boss can count on to resolve problems and move the project forward, you'll be regarded as an extreamly valuable asset

## How To Dress

* People will, and do, huge you by your appearance
* Dress two levels above where you currently area
* When in doubt, follow how the leader dresses


## Acing the Review Process

*  If anything on your annual review or anything your boss says about your annual review is a shock to you, you've already messed up
*  You should be checking in with your boss on how you are progressing, at least once every two weeks. Preferably once a week
*  You should ask point blank how you are doing and if there is anything, anything at all, that you are doing that could use improvement
*  Show how you have improved each review
*  Document what you do
*  What ever your goal is, figure it out and make it known
*  Document the books you've read, anything trainings you've attended or given. Anything that shows your improvement and progress towards your goals.
*  Pretend your a lawyer and build your case
*  If you can, refuse to rate yourself, Just say you cant rate yourself in a unbiased way
*  If you have to rate yourself, rate yourself as highly as possible in all areas but your weakest one and give yourself one mark below perfect there
*  Nothing good can come of giving your peers bad ratings

## Getting A raise or Promotion

* Getting a good review does not mean getting a raise or promotion
* Always chose more responsibility over pay
* You can always trade power for money
* If you want to get a raise, if you want to get a promotion, **DO MORE THAN WHAT IS ASKED OF YOU**
* Constantly invest in your education
* Don't be afraid to spend some money to make more money
* If you want to get paid more money, the equation is simple: **Make the company more money**
* Try to figure out how what you are doing directly impacts the revenue your company makes
* When you go for a raise, the best argument you could possible make is that you are making the company more money
* Don't make a threat that you are going to leave if you do not get a raise
* Don't talk about why you need the money

## Advancing Your Career

## Generalist VS Specialist

* Specialization is the way forward
* However to do this, you need to have a broad base
* Its very difficult to be a good specialist without also building abroad base of general knowledge about your field
* Have at least one area of deep, specialized knowledge or skill
* What people want is a specialist but someone who is versatile and flexible - You know a subject deeply, but also know other subjects as well

## Creating a Blog

* If you blog regularly and consistently, it's almost guaranteed that someone searching for your name on the internet will find your blog
* Think of a blog as an advertisement for you that works all day and night without you having to do anything

* You want to make the theme of your blog very focused and small initially
* Think about what kind of theme you can pick for your blog where you can be known for being number one in the world
* Make sure you know what you are going to write before you write it
* Create some kind of an outline before you start writing
* Types of blog posts you could pick:
	* How-to post showing how to do something
	* Opinion post where you are expressing your opinion about technology, framework, programming language ect
	* Opinion post where you are talking about a general concept or methodology, and why it is good or bad
	* Reviewing a product or service
	* Expert round up where you review a product or service
	* Explainer pot where you explain a topic to your audience so that they can understand it better
* The most important thing you can do is to be consistent
* Put in your calendar the exact time and date that each post is due to be published and the exact time and date you are going to write it
* The key is to create good content that people will want to share and link to
* Don't present your work in an academic way, do it in an entertaining way
* your voice in writing is who you are
* Don't be afraid to insert some personality into your writing


## Side Projects

* You should always have a side project that you are actively working on
* One six month side project has the potential to gain you the experience it might take you years to get just working your 9 to 5
* Your first side project should be a clone of something that already exists
* Make the side project serve at least two of the following purposes:
	* Learning a new language
	* Learning a new framework
	* Practicing an existing skill or master it
	* Creating an app to solve some problem
	* Creating an app to solve someone else problem
