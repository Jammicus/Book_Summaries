## The Value of Empathy

* Don't be motivated by recognition from above, be motivated to give protection from all levels of the organization
* Leaders must prioritize the well-being of their people, and advance the well-being of one another and the organization
* Leading with empathy will inturn make your followers work harder for you

-------
## Employees are People Too

* Listen to what others have to say
* Ensure that there is a culture of truth telling, as long as they tell the truth, they will be OK
* Empathy and trust must run throughout the organisation
* Employees, no matter what rank, must all be treated as equals
* Build a culture where people feel like they belong
* ` When you have people who trust you, they're going to do a better job for you to earn or keep that trust `
* Remember above all else that they are humans with emotions, care for them deeply

---------

## We See What We Want to See

* Create an environment in which people felt they could express themselves honestly and be recognized and celebrated for their progress
* To create this environment it will have to be a series of little things that are implemented over time
* The first thing you should do is to make it so that your employees feel inspired, safe, fulfilled and grateful when they return from work.

-------

## The Awesome Responsibility

* While your employees are at work, their safety and happiness are your resposibility, they deserve your love and care
* Being a leader is like being a parent, and the company is like a new family to join
* In sickness and in health, take care of them
* As a leader, it is your sole responsibility to protect your people, and in turn, your people will protect each other and advance the organization together.

---------

## From "Me" to "We"

* I, me, my should be removed from your vocabulary. Its not we, together, us.
* As a leader you define a circle of safety around your group. **Its your choice as to who you allow into your circle of safety, and your job to keep it safe**
* This is done by setting a culture free of danger from each other. Which is achieved by giving people a sense of belonging
* Offer them a culture based on a clear set of human values and beliefs, along with the power to make decisions. Offer them trust and empathy
* Letting someone into an organization is like adopting a child
* Leaders should set the standard of entry to the circle of safety, and assess people based on whether their views and chracter will fit the group
* The benefits of the team should extend to everyone in that team, no matter what position they hold
* When the circle of safety is working they will feel valued by their colleagues and feel cared for by our superiors. 
* The ultimate question "How safe do you feel where you work?"

## It's All About the Group
* Always protect your own, there will be internal disagreements,but when outside attacks come, you rally together

---------

## Generosity and Other Ways to Build Trust

* Helping others gives both of you a shot of oxytocin AND others who witness it
* Aim to flood the group with oxytocin

---------

## Cortisol

* The greatest problem for a team
* This should be reduced at all costs

---------


## Fire Your Children

* Think of followers like your children.
* Rather than fire people, coach people
* Take extra time determining who you should let in, rather than hiring and then firing people
* People would rather feel safe among their colleagues, have the opportunity to grow and feel a part of something bigger than themselves than work in a place that simply makes them feel rich
* When the time is taken to build proper relationships and when leaders choose to put their people before their numbers, when we can actually feel a sense of trust for each other, the oxytocin release in our bodies can reverse many of the negative effects of operating in a high-stress, cortisol-soaked environment.
* As long as there are human beings brought together for a common cause, leaders can choose to set any kind of culture they want

---------

## Why We Have Leaders

* To keep order and protect others
* Status is biological, we have to earn it to feel it
* Leadership status is not just reserved for people, its offered to the group itself
* Advantages of leadership does not come freely, more often it comes at a steep price. You have to lose your self interest, and instead you must be willing to sacrifice for the good of those who follow you
* Companies earn their reputations by being willing to do the right thing for their people and their customers or clients
* If someone wont make personal sacrifices for the group, they are not leaders
* **THE KEY IS OUR LEADERS ARE SUPPOSED TO SERVE US, NOT THEMSELVES, TO PROTECT THOSE IN OUR CARE**
* Leaders are the ones willing to look out for those to the left of them and the right of them
* What makes a good leader is that they eschew the spotlight in favor of spending time and energy to do what they need to do to support and protect their people

----------

## The Ceramic Cup

* “This is the most important lesson I can impart to all of you,” he offered. “All the perks, all the benefits and advantages you may get for the rank or position you hold, they aren’t meant for you. They are meant for the role you fill. And when you leave your role, which eventually you will, they will give the ceramic cup to the person who replaces you. Because you only ever deserved a Styrofoam cup”

---------

## Eating Last Is Repaid with Loyalty and Hard Work

* "He came to see his company as a family, as a group of people to serve and keep safe and not just a labor force to be used to serve the company"
* "It is better that we all suffer a litte, so that none of us has to suffer a lot"
* The safety of a strong tribe provides its memebers makes the stribe stronger and better equipped to deal with the dangers and uncertainty of the outside world. 

----------

## Know When to Break the Rules

* We dont just trust people to obey the rules, we also trust that they know when to break them.
* The responsibility of leaders is to teach their people the rules, train them to gain competency and build their confidence. Leadership must then step back and trust that their people know what they are doing all will do what needs to be done.
* The responsibility of a leader is to provide cover from above for their people who are working below. 
* Our confidence to do what's right is determined by how trusted we feel by our leaders
* You must give your followers complete flexibility

---------

## When Leaders Eat First

* Too many of the environments in  which we work today frustrate our natural inclinations to trust and cooperate
* " No one wakes up  in the morning to go to work with the hope that someone will manage us. We wake up in the morning and go to work with the hope that someone will lead 

---------
## Abstraction Kills

* There is a lack of leaders who do see their followers as people
* Care is often only extended to ourselves and our own safety, not our followers

---------
## Modern Abstraction
* You must go to all levels of the organisation and make yourself present. Don't take results from the spreadsheets

---------
## Managing the Abstraction

* Rule 1 -  Keep it real, bring people together
	* Make others meet in person, have the important topics talked about in person. Spend time with others
* Rule 2 - Keep it manageable, obey dunbars number
	* Run a teams of <150 people
	* When a leader gets to know everyone personally in a group, the responsibility for their care becomes personal.
	* Managers must become leaders in their own right, which means they must take responsibility for the care and protect of those in their charge, confident that their leaders will take care of them.
	* Have a policy of cooperation, sharing and open communication
* Rule 3. Meet the People You Help
	* Its imperative for us to see the actual, tangible impact of our time and effort for our work to have meaning and for us to be motivated to do it even better.
	* When you see the physical impact, it inspires us to work harder and do more
	* Bringing people in to talk about how their work improved someones life is an excellent example
	* It needs to envoking feelings for the people, its not about numbers.
* Rule 4. Given them Time, Not Just Money
	* Time and effort have an absolute value, we all share the fact we have only 24 hours in a day
	* If someone is willing to give us something of which they have a fixed and finite amount, a completely nonredeemable commodity, we perceive greater value.
	* Energy also matters, you must be present with them, not distracted by other things
	* What produces loyalty, that irrational willingness to commit to the organization, even when offered more money elsewhere, is the feeling that the leaders of the company would be willing, when it matters, to sacrifice their time and energy to help us
	* We will judge a boss who spends time after hours to help us as more valuable than a boss who siply gives us a bonus when we hit a target
	* Simply hearing about the time and energy soeone gave to other can inspire us to want to do more for others too
	* A leader offers their time and energy to those in their care
* Rule 5. Be patient, the rules of seven days and seven years
	* We instinctively know that the strong bond of human trust cannot be formed after one date or even after one week. 
	* Strong feelings after a first date/ job interview is dopamine fueled
	* Building trust takes time and paitence.

## Becoming a leader

* Its commitment to make another person into a leader
* Confronting threats alone is impossible, you need to make others leaders to help you with this

---------

## Shared Struggle

* Its not the work we remember with fondness, but the camarderie, how the group came together to get things done
* Its about coming together during the hard times, than being there together through the good times.
* During the hard times, you must help each other through it, rather than going alone
* Struggles should be defined as success stories on how the team got through it
* Follows must feel that this hardship is for the best of the common goal
