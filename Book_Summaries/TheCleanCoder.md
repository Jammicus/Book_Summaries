# The Clean Coder - Robert C. Martin

## Professionalism

### Be Careful What you Ask for

* Professionals is a marker of responsibility and accountability. 
* You can't take pride and honor in something that you can't be held accountable for

### Taking Responsibility

* Take responsibility for your customers service and your employeers repuation. 
* Sometimes doing the responsible thing will let others down, but it will be benfitical for others in the long run

### First, Do No Harm

* You need to be responsible for your imperfections
* Its impossible to write code that does not have bugs
* You are responsible for making sure that key areas of risk have been addressed and dealt with.
* You cannot keep making errors over and over

### QA Should Find Nothing

* When you release your software to the QA team, they should find no problems
* Its extreamly unprofessional to send coe that you know to be faulty to QA
* Faulty code is any code you aren't certain about
* QA will find bugs, get ready to apologize and then figure out why those bugs managed to escapeyour notice and do something to prevent it from happening again

### You Must Know How It Works

* Test, test and test again
* All of your code should be covered with automated unit tests
* Every single long of coe you write should be tested. Period
* Code is only hard to test if it has been designed to be hard to test

### Automated QA

* Your automated tests should tell you that the system is very likely to pass QA

### Do No Harm To Structure

* The fundamental assumption underlying all software projects is that software is easy to change.
* If you violate this by creating inflexible code, you rbeak the model that the industry is based on
* You should be able to make changes without high costs
* **Always check in a module cleaner than when you checked it out. Always make some random act of kindness to the coe whever you see it**
* If you have a utomated suite of tests that cover virtually 100% of the code, and if that suite of tests can be executed quickly, you will not fear making changes

### Work Ethic

* Your career is your responsibility. 
* Never fall into the trap of thinking that it is your employers responsbility
* Its not your employers responsiblity to give you the time you need ot learn
* You should plan to work 60 hours a week - 40 for your employer, and 20 for you (Thats around 3 extra hours a day just for you)

### Know Your Field

* How much do you know about your field?
* The following is the minimal list any software devleoper should know:
	* Design patterns - Describe all 24 and have knowing knowledge of many of them
	* Design principles - know all the SOLID principles and good understanding of the component principles
	* Methods - Understanding of XP, Scrum, Kanban, Waterfall, Strucutred Analysis and structured design
	* Disciplines - Practice the following: TDD, Object - oriented deisgn, structured programming, continuous integration, and pair programming
	* Artifacts - how to use UML, DFDs, Structure Charts, Petrinets, state transition diagrams andtables, flow charts and decision tables

### Contnuous Learning

* Would you visit a doctor who does not keep current with medical hournals?
* Read books, articles, blogs, tweets
* G to conferences, usergroups
* Learn new languages

### Practice

* Professionals practice
* True professionals work hard to keep their skills sharp and ready
* Practice using Katas. 
* Try to aim to do one or two katas each day (More on practicing later)
* Think of them as a ten minute warm up and 10 minute warm down each day

### Collaboration

* Second best way to learn is to collaborate with other people
* Professionals make a special effort to program together, practice together, design and plan together

### Mentoring

* The best way to learn is to teach
* There is no better way to bring new people into an organization than to sit down with them and show them the ropes. 
* Professionals take personal responsibility for mentoring juniors

### Know your domain

* You are responsible for understanding the domain of the solution you are programming
* If you are writing an accounting system, you should know the accounting field
* When starting a project in a new domain, read a book or two on the topic.
* Spend time with experts in that field to understand their principles and values
* Its unprofessional behavior to simply code from a spec without understanding why that spec makes sense to the business

### Identify With Your Employer/Customer

* Your Employer's problems are your problems.
* Understand these problems and work toward the best solutions
* Its easy to feel like you are against your employer, try to avoid this 

### Humility

* Professionals  takes pride in his work
* Profesionals are confident in his abilities, and take bold, calculated risks based on their confidence
* When a professional finds himself the butt of a joke,, he's the first to laugh
* He will never ridicule others, but will accept ridcule when it is deserved and laugh it off when it is not.
* He will punish another for making a mistake, as mistakes are necessary

## Saying No

* Professionals speak truth to power. 
* Professionals have the courage to say no to their managers
* Professionals are expected to say no!
* Good managers crave someone who has the guys to say no

### Adversarial Roles

* Professionals will pursue and defend their objects as aggressively as they can
* You and your manager must come to the best possible outcome for both of you
* Negotiating this can be unpleasent
* You do this by saying no, then working out a solution that was mutually agreeable to both

### High Stakes

* The most important time is to say no when the stakes are highest

### Being A Team Player

* This means playing your position the best you can, while being ready to help your team mates out when they hit a jam
* Team players do not say yes all the time
* Team players communicate frequently, and keep an eye out for his or her team mates

### Trying

* The promise to try is admitting that you are holding back. 
* By promising to try you are promising to change your plans


## Saying Yes

### A Language of Commitment

* Three parts to making a commitment:
	* you day you'll do it
	* You mean it
	* You actually do it

### Recognizing Lack of Commitment

* Phrases that demonstrate noncommitment:
	* Need/Should
	* Hope/wish
	* Lets

### What Does Commitment Sound Like

* I will....by...
* Commitment is stating what you can do by a time you set. Without needing others
* You need to take full responsibility or this
* You can only commit to things you have full control voer


## Coding

### Preparedness

* Coding requires you to juggle many competing factors at once
	* Your code must work, meaning you must understand the problem and how to solve it. 
	* Your code must also solve the problem set by the customer.
	* Your code must fit well into the existing system
	* Your code must be readable by other programmers
* If you are tired and distracted, do not code. You'll only end dup redoing what you did. 
* Try to eliminate the distractions and settle your mind

### 3 AM Code

* Don't write code when you are tired
* Dedication and professionalism are more about discipline than hours

### Worry Code

* When you are worried and anxious, this is the worst time to code. The code you produce will be shitty
* You should instead go and resolve the worry
* If you cannot resolve the worry, you must shut down the background process, or at least reduce its priority so that it's not a continuous distraction

### The Flow Zone

* Avoid the zone
* The zone is an unncommunicative state

### Music

* Becareful that the music you are listening to does either distract you passively, or force you to enter the zone

### Interruptions

* Be polite and helpful when you are interrupted. Don't be mean and demanding

### Writers Block

* When you are having block, find a pair partner
* This will knock you out the block and give you a fresh perspective
* If you can't get a pair partner, do somethign creative
* Read, draw anything that gives your mind a break from the problem

### Debugging

* TDD will help preventing you from spending a considerable amount of time on debugging

###Â Pacing yourself

* Developing software is a marathon, not a sprint
* You win be conserving resources and pacing yourself

### Know When To Walk Away

* When you are stuck or tired, disengage for a while

### Driving Home

* On your journey home from work, take your mind away from the problems at work

### Being Late

* You will be late
* To manage lateness you need to identify it early, and be transparent
* Do this by regularly measuring your progress against your goal, and come up with three fact-based end dates: best case, nominal case and worst case

### Hope

* Always avoid hoping! 
* Hope is a project killer and destroys schedules and repuations


### Rushing

* There is no way to rush
* This will cause longer damage in the long run

### Overtime

* Overtime can work and sometimes is neessary
* You should however not agree to overtime unless:
	* You can personally afford it
	* Its only a short period, eg 2 weeks or less
	* Your boss has a fall back plan in case the overtime effort fails

### Help

* No matter how skilled you are, you will certainly benefit from another programmers thoughts and ideas

### Helping Others

* It is your responsibility to help others
* You should be conscious of the status of your teammates. If you see team mate who appears in trouble, you should offer to help
* When you help someone, sit down and write code together

### Being Helped

* Be gracious when others offer to help
* Accept the help gratefully and give yourself to that help
* Do not protect your turf


## Test Driven Development

### The Three Laws of TDD

1. You are not allowed to write any production code until you have first written a failing unit test
2. You are not allowed to write more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail - and not compiling is failing
3. You are not allowed to write more production code that is sufficient to pass the current failing unit test

## Practicing

* All professionals practice their art by engaging in skill-sharpening exercises
* Katas are excellent ways to practice

### Broadening Your Experience

* Work on open source projects
* Try contributing to something which is not your primary language
* Practice ethics

## Acceptance Testing

### Communicating Requirements

* Often the best way to determine requirements is to get the user to sit with you while you code features, and let them define how you should improve these/ design these

### Acceptance tests

* What is the defintion of done?
* In an ideal world, QA and stakeholders would collaborate to write these tests, and developers would review them
* Business analyists write the happy path versions, where QA's write the unhappy path
* Acceptance testing should be as late as possible, generally a few days before the feature is implemented
* Acceptance tests are not unit tests
* Unit tests are for programmers by programmers
* Aceptnace tests are written by the business for the business

## Testing Strategies

### QA Should Find Nothing

* QAs should find nothing when testing your code
* The QA is part of the team. Devs and QAs should work together to ensure the quality of the system
* QA's role to work with business to create the automated acceptance tests that before the true specification and requirements of the system.

**Google test automation pyramid**

### Unit tests

* Test individual units of the program
* Written by programmers for programmers
* SHould have around 90% coverage of a feature

### Component tests

* Writen against the programs component
* Tests wrap a component, then pass input data into the component and gathers output data from it
* Tests that the out matches the input correctly
* These are written by QA and business as assistance to development
* These cover roughly half the system

### Integration Tests

* These test how components work together
* The make sure that components are joined correctly and are properly connected and can communicate clearly with each other
* Written by system architects or lead designers
* Generally written in the same language and environment as component tests
* Typically not part of continuous integrations uite

### System Tests

* Automated tests that execute against the entire system.
* They are the ultimate integration tsts
* Tests that the system has been wired together correctly and its part interoperate according to plan
* Written by system archiects and leads

## Time Management

### Meetings

* Decline meetings that are not immediately necessary
* Decide whether this is best for the project
* Important duty of your manager is to keep you out of meetings
* Good managers will be more than willing to defend your decision to decline attendance because that manager is just as concerned about your time as you are
* You can leave meetings if it is not a good use of your time. Just find a way to politely exit that meeting
* if you go to a meeting, have an agenda and goal
* For standup meetings, each participant should answer the following:
	1. What did I do yesterday?
	2. What am I going to do today?
	3. What's in my way?

* Interation planning meetings are design to mvoe items from the backlog into the next iteration
* Backlog items should be quickly discussed then either selected or rejected
* Retrospectives should 20-25 mintues long
* When debating/arguing, anything that cannot be solved in 5 minutes cannot be solved

### Focus - Manna

* Sleep is extreamly important, make sure you get enough
* Monitor how much caffine you are having, make sure its not too mcuh
* Recharing should be done by de-focussing. Do this by walking away from your code for a while
* Physical exercise is also extreamly important. 

### Time Boxing and Tomatoes

* Use the pomodoro technique/ tomatoes
* Set a timer for 25 mintues and aim to get a goal done in that time
* Nothing should interfere you during those 25 mintues
* When the timer goes off, stop immediately and have a short break
* After 4 iterations, take a longer break
* On a good day, you can get 12-14 tomatoes done.  
* When you get comfortable with this, you can measure how long something will take in tomatoes

### Priority Inversion

* The higher priority a task is, the sooner you should do it

## Estimation TODO

## Preasure

### Avoiding pressure

* Best way to say calm is to avoid situations that cause pressure
* Avoid making too many commitments, or commitments that may cause too much pressure
* Keep your code and designs clean. This will reduce the stress
* Choose a discipline to use when in a crisis (Eg, TDD).
* Dont change your behaviour when the crunch comes.

### Handling pressure

* Mangage your stress.
* Slow down and think the problem through
* Communicate with others and let them know you are in trouble, and your plan for getting out of trouble.
* Ask others for input and guidance
* Rely on your disciplines, trust that these will work and help you through
* Pair when you are struggling

## Collaboration

* Its good to be passionate about what you do, but its also important to keep your eye on the goals of people who pay you
* The first responsibility of the professional programmer is to meet the needs of his or her employer
* Professional programmers take the time to understand the business and the users about the software they are using
* Pay attention to internal politics
* Understand your superiors worries
* Unprofessional programmers put walls around their code and refuses to let other programmers touch it
* Its better to break code into ownership, and have the team own all the code
* Professionals do not prevent others from working on their code, they work with each other on as much of the system as they can
* Its best to collaborate closely with others and to pair with them a large fraction of the time

## Teams and Projects

* There is no half person - it makes no sense to tell a programmer to devote half their time to project A and the rest of their time to project B
* Gelled teams can work miracles. They anticipate each other, cover for each other, support each other, and demand the best from each other
* Gelled teams normally consist of about a dozen people
* The team should be composed of programmers, testers, and analysts with a project managers
* 2:1 ratio of developers to testers and analysts is a good 
* A gelled team plan together, solve problems together, face issues together and get things done
* Its best to keep a team together and feed new projects to that team
* Teams have different velocity - a rate of how much work they can get done in a fixed period
* Gelled teams can work on multiple projects at a time

## Craftsmanship

* Craftmanship is the mindset held by craftsmen. Its contains values, disciplines, techniques, attitudes and answers
* These mindsets are passed down 
* You must make your mindset observable. You act as the role model
* You become a craftsman first, and let your craftsmanship show.
